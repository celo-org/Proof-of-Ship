## Recommendations for Improvement

Since no Self Protocol integration exists, the recommendations focus on initiating this integration.

-   **High Priority**:
    1.  **Introduce Self Protocol SDK**: Begin by integrating the official `@selfxyz/core` and `@selfxyz/qrcode` SDKs into the frontend.
    2.  **Define Identity Verification Requirements**: Clearly outline which identity attributes (e.g., age, country of residence, document type) need to be verified for the Dezenmart application.
    3.  **Establish Backend Verification Endpoint**: Create a dedicated backend service to receive and process proofs from the Self SDK, interacting with the `SelfVerificationRoot` contract.
    4.  **Implement Basic Verification Flow**: Develop a fundamental flow including QR code generation on the frontend and proof verification on the backend.

-   **Medium Priority**:
    1.  **Design Smart Contract Integration**: If custom on-chain logic is required, design a smart contract that extends `SelfVerificationRoot` and implements `customVerificationHook()` to define application-specific verification rules.
    2.  **Implement Error Handling**: Incorporate robust error handling for all Self SDK interactions and contract calls.
    3.  **User Context Data**: Plan for how user-specific context data will be managed and passed during the verification process to enhance security and user experience.

-   **Low Priority**:
    1.  **Explore Advanced Features**: Once basic integration is stable, investigate features like dynamic configuration, multi-document support, and selective disclosure for enhanced privacy.
    2.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop a thorough testing strategy for all Self Protocol-related components, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

-   **Self-Specific**:
    1.  **Leverage `SelfAppBuilder`**: Utilize `SelfAppBuilder` for streamlined configuration of verification requests.
    2.  **Attestation ID Management**: Plan for proper management and storage of attestation IDs.
    3.  **Privacy by Design**: Ensure that nullifier handling and data minimization principles are applied from the outset.

## Technical Assessment from Senior Blockchain Developer Perspective

The current state of the Dezenmart frontend repository, as evidenced by the provided `README.md` file, indicates a complete absence of Self Protocol integration. Therefore, a technical assessment from a senior blockchain developer perspective regarding Self Protocol cannot be provided beyond stating that no integration exists. The project is at a pre-integration stage for Self Protocol. To achieve a meaningful assessment, actual code demonstrating SDK usage, contract interactions, and verification flows would be required. The existing repository metrics suggest a nascent project with basic development practices, which would need significant architectural and development effort to incorporate a robust identity verification solution like Self Protocol.
