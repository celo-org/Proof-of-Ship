I apologize, but I cannot perform the requested analysis because **no code digest was provided**. The prompt states: "Error fetching repository: Repository not found. Make sure it is public or that you have provided a valid token."

To provide a comprehensive assessment focusing on Self Protocol features, I require the actual code or a relevant code digest.

Please provide the code digest, and I will be happy to proceed with the analysis as per your detailed instructions.
