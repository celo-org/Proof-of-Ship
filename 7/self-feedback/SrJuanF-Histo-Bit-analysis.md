## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|:---------|:-------------|:--------------|
| Self SDK Integration Quality | 6.5/10 | SDKs are correctly imported and initialized. `SelfAppBuilder` and `SelfQRcodeWrapper` are used. However, `userId` is hardcoded, and `disclosures` are minimal/inconsistent across components. |
| Contract Integration | 0.0/10 | No evidence of direct Self Protocol smart contract integration (e.g., `SelfVerificationRoot` inheritance, direct calls to Self Protocol verification contracts) in the provided Solidity code. Identity verification appears to be entirely off-chain. |
| Identity Verification Implementation | 5.0/10 | Basic QR code generation and universal link functionality are present. The flow for successful verification updates local storage. However, the `userId` is hardcoded, and the "Facial Recognition" and "Register New Account" steps are simulated, not Self Protocol integrations. |
| Proof Functionality | 4.0/10 | The backend verifier (`SelfBackendVerifier`) is correctly used to process proofs. It includes basic `minimumAge` disclosure and placeholder `ofac`/`excludedCountries` checks in its *configuration*, but the frontend `disclosures` are very minimal (`minimumAge` only, `nationality`/`gender` set to `false`). The provided code does not demonstrate advanced proof types or multi-document handling. |
| Code Quality & Architecture | 5.5/10 | Self-specific code is somewhat isolated in `KYCComponent.tsx` and `api/verify/route.ts`. Error handling is present but basic. Key architectural flaws include hardcoded `userId` and simulated features presented as verification methods. Overall project lacks comprehensive tests and CI/CD. |
| **Overall Technical Score** | 4.2/10 | The project demonstrates a foundational understanding of Self Protocol's frontend SDK and backend verification, but it falls short on critical aspects like dynamic user identification, advanced feature leverage, and robust contract-level integration. The hardcoded `userId` is a significant flaw, and the simulated features dilute the actual Self integration. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal related to Self Protocol**: The primary goal is to integrate Self Protocol for Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification, enabling users (Patients, Doctors, Insurers, Auditors) to prove their identity to access the Histo-Bit decentralized medical records system.
- **Problem solved for identity verification users/developers**: For users, it aims to provide a privacy-preserving method to verify their identity using a mobile app, rather than traditional centralized KYC processes. For developers, it provides a basic example of integrating Self Protocol's frontend QR code generation and backend proof verification.
- **Target users/beneficiaries within privacy-preserving identity space**: Patients, Doctors, Insurers, and Auditors who need to verify their identity to interact with the Histo-Bit platform, with an emphasis on patient control over medical data and privacy.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (79.67%), Solidity (14.81%), JavaScript (3.67%), CSS (1.85%).
- **Self-specific libraries and frameworks used**:
    - `@selfxyz/common`
    - `@selfxyz/core` (for `SelfBackendVerifier`, `DefaultConfigStore`, `AllIds`, `getUniversalLink`)
    - `@selfxyz/qrcode` (for `SelfQRcodeWrapper`, `SelfAppBuilder`)
- **Smart contract standards and patterns used**: OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` and `ReentrancyGuard` are used in the `AccessControl` and `DocsRecords` contracts. Custom access control and event-based logging are implemented.
- **Frontend/backend technologies supporting Self integration**:
    - **Frontend**: Next.js (version 15.5.0), React (version 19.1.0), Tailwind CSS.
    - **Backend (API route)**: Next.js API Routes (for `app/api/verify/route.ts`).

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure**: The project is split into a Next.js frontend (`histo-bit-frontend`), a Hardhat-based Solidity smart contract suite (`Onchain`), and a GraphQL subgraph for indexing blockchain data (`Graphs/docs-records`).
- **Key components and their Self interactions**:
    - **`histo-bit-frontend/app/components/KYCComponent.tsx`**: Frontend component responsible for initiating the Self Protocol verification flow. It uses `SelfAppBuilder` to create a Self application configuration and `SelfQRcodeWrapper` to display a QR code for mobile scanning. It also generates a universal link. Upon successful verification (handled by a backend API route), it sets `isKYCVerified` in local storage.
    - **`histo-bit-frontend/app/api/verify/route.ts`**: Backend API endpoint that receives the Self Protocol proof (attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData). It uses `SelfBackendVerifier` to validate the proof against configured disclosures.
    - **`histo-bit-frontend/app/hooks/useKYCProtection.ts`**: A custom React hook that checks `isKYCVerified` status from local storage and redirects unverified users to the `/kyc` page.
- **Smart contract architecture (Self-related contracts)**: The provided Solidity smart contracts (`AccessControl.sol`, `AuditTrail.sol`, `DocsRecords.sol`) do *not* have any direct integration with Self Protocol. They manage roles, documents, and audit trails for the Histo-Bit application's core logic. Self Protocol's role is purely for off-chain identity proof before a user interacts with the application.
- **Self integration approach (SDK vs direct contracts)**: The project primarily uses the Self Protocol SDKs (frontend and backend verifier) for off-chain identity verification. There is no direct smart contract integration with Self Protocol's on-chain verification roots or identity contracts.

## Security Analysis
- **Self-specific security patterns**:
    - **Proof Verification**: The backend API (`app/api/verify/route.ts`) correctly uses `SelfBackendVerifier` to validate zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the identity claims.
    - **User Context Data**: `userContextData` is passed to the verifier, which is a good practice for linking the verification session to the user.
- **Input validation for verification parameters**: The backend API checks for the presence of `attestationId`, `proof`, `publicSignals`, and `userContextData`. Basic error handling is in place for verification failures.
- **Privacy protection mechanisms**: The use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs via Self Protocol inherently provides privacy by allowing users to prove attributes (e.g., minimum age) without revealing the underlying sensitive data (e.g., exact date of birth). The `disclosures` configuration in `KYCComponent.tsx` is minimal (`minimumAge: 18`, `nationality: false`, `gender: false`), which suggests data minimization, though `nationality` and `gender` being false means they are not requested to be disclosed.
- **Identity data validation**: The `SelfBackendVerifier` handles the cryptographic validation of the identity proofs. The application then relies on the `isValidDetails.isValid` flag from the Self Protocol result.
- **Transaction security for Self operations**: Self Protocol operations themselves (proof generation, submission) are handled by the SDKs. The `histo-bit-frontend/app/api/verify/route.ts` endpoint is a standard Next.js API route, and its security would depend on standard web security practices (HTTPS, rate limiting, etc.), which are not explicitly detailed in the digest. The hardcoded `userId` in `KYCComponent.tsx` is a severe security flaw, as it means all users are attempting to verify the *same* identity, making the verification process effectively useless for individual user identification.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Self core functionalities implemented**:
    - Self App configuration (`SelfAppBuilder`).
    - QR code generation and display (`SelfQRcodeWrapper`).
    - Universal link generation.
    - Backend proof verification (`SelfBackendVerifier`).
    - Basic disclosure request (`minimumAge`).
- **Verification execution correctness**: The code structure for initiating verification (frontend) and processing proofs (backend) appears syntactically correct based on Self SDK usage. However, the hardcoded `userId` means that in a real-world scenario, the verification would not be tied to the actual user attempting to log in, rendering it functionally incorrect for personalized identity.
- **Error handling for Self operations**: Basic `onError` callbacks are implemented in `SelfQRcodeWrapper` and `try-catch` blocks in the API route. Toast notifications are used for user feedback.
- **Edge case handling for identity verification**: Limited. The code does not explicitly handle scenarios like network failures during proof submission, user canceling the process on the Self app, or specific ZKP validation failures beyond a generic "Verification failed" message. The hardcoded `userId` also bypasses proper user identification.
- **Testing strategy for Self features**: The provided `Graphs/docs-records/tests/docs-records.test.ts` are for the subgraph, not for the Self Protocol integration. The codebase weaknesses indicate "Missing tests" for the overall project, implying no specific tests for the Self integration.

## Code Quality & Architecture
- **Code organization for Self features**: Self Protocol integration logic is primarily encapsulated within `KYCComponent.tsx` (frontend) and `app/api/verify/route.ts` (backend), which is a reasonable separation of concerns.
- **Documentation quality for Self integration**: The `README.md` mentions "KYC Integration: Self Protocol integration for identity verification" and "Key Management: Based on biometric proof of human identity/presence and Self Protocol App." However, there's no dedicated documentation explaining the specifics of the Self integration, its configuration, or how to test it. Comments in the code are minimal for Self-related logic.
- **Naming conventions for Self-related components**: Standard Self SDK naming conventions (`SelfQRcodeWrapper`, `SelfAppBuilder`, `SelfBackendVerifier`) are followed.
- **Complexity management in verification logic**: The verification logic itself (calling `selfBackendVerifier.verify`) is straightforward due to the SDK abstraction. The complexity arises from the simulated "Facial Recognition" and "Register New Account" flows in `KYCComponent.tsx`, which are not part of Self Protocol and could be misleading.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Self SDK and library management**: Self SDKs (`@selfxyz/common`, `@selfxyz/core`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`) are correctly listed in `histo-bit-frontend/package.json` with specific versions.
- **Installation process for Self dependencies**: Standard `npm install` (or `yarn install`) will pull these dependencies.
- **Configuration approach for Self networks**: Environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT`) are used for Self App configuration, which is a good practice. `endpointType` is hardcoded to "staging_celo".
- **Deployment considerations for Self integration**: The environment variables need to be correctly set in the deployment environment. The backend API route (`/api/verify`) must be accessible to the frontend.

## Self Protocol Integration Analysis

### 1. **Self SDK Usage**
- **File Path**: `histo-bit-frontend/package.json`, `histo-bit-frontend/app/components/KYCComponent.tsx`, `histo-bit-frontend/app/api/verify/route.ts`
- **Implementation Quality**: Intermediate
- **Code Snippet**:
    - `package.json`:
        ```json
        "@selfxyz/common": "^0.0.7",
        "@selfxyz/core": "^1.0.8",
        "@selfxyz/qrcode": "^1.0.11",
        ```
    - `KYCComponent.tsx`:
        ```typescript
        import { SelfQRcodeWrapper, SelfAppBuilder, type SelfApp } from "@selfxyz/qrcode";
        import { getUniversalLink } from "@selfxyz/core";
        // ...
        const app = new SelfAppBuilder({
            version: 2,
            appName: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME || "Self Workshop",
            scope: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE || "self-workshop",
            endpoint: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT}`,
            logoBase64: "https://i.postimg.cc/mrmVf9hm/self.png",
            userId: userId, // Hardcoded: "0xc060DbB08Cd8980479bFfe829236Bcb9a1D9bD06"
            endpointType: "staging_celo",
            userIdType: "hex",
            userDefinedData: "Bonjour Cannes!",
            disclosures: {
                minimumAge: 18,
                nationality: false,
                gender: false,
            }
        }).build();
        setSelfApp(app);
        setUniversalLink(getUniversalLink(app));
        // ...
        <SelfQRcodeWrapper selfApp={selfApp} onSuccess={handleSuccessfulVerification} onError={() => { displayToast("Error: Failed to verify identity"); }} />
        ```
    - `app/api/verify/route.ts`:
        ```typescript
        import { SelfBackendVerifier, AllIds, DefaultConfigStore, VerificationConfig } from "@selfxyz/core";
        // ...
        const disclosures_config: VerificationConfig = {
            excludedCountries: [],
            ofac: false,
            minimumAge: 18,
        };
        const configStore = new DefaultConfigStore(disclosures_config);
        const selfBackendVerifier = new SelfBackendVerifier(
            "self-workshop",
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT || "",
            true, // isStaging
            AllIds,
            configStore,
            "hex",
        );
        const result = await selfBackendVerifier.verify(attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData);
        ```
- **Security Assessment**: The use of environment variables for `appName`, `scope`, and `endpoint` is good. The `userId` being hardcoded is a critical security vulnerability, as it means all users are attempting to verify the same identity. This completely undermines the purpose of individual identity verification. The `logoBase64` being a direct URL is acceptable but could be a data URI for better self-containment.

### 2. **Contract Integration**
- **File Path**: `Onchain/contracts/AccessControl.sol`, `Onchain/contracts/AuditTrail.sol`, `Onchain/contracts/DocsRecords.sol`
- **Implementation Quality**: None (0.0/10)
- **Code Snippet**: No relevant code snippets for Self Protocol contract integration.
- **Security Assessment**: As there is no direct contract integration, there are no Self-specific contract vulnerabilities or best practices to assess here. The smart contracts focus on internal access control and document management.

### 3. **Identity Verification Implementation**
- **File Path**: `histo-bit-frontend/app/components/KYCComponent.tsx`, `histo-bit-frontend/app/api/verify/route.ts`, `histo-bit-frontend/app/hooks/useKYCProtection.ts`
- **Implementation Quality**: Basic
- **Code Snippet**:
    - `KYCComponent.tsx` (QR Code Integration):
        ```typescript
        <SelfQRcodeWrapper selfApp={selfApp} onSuccess={handleSuccessfulVerification} onError={() => { displayToast("Error: Failed to verify identity"); }} />
        // ...
        const handleSuccessfulVerification = () => {
          displayToast("Verification successful! Redirecting to dashboard...");
          localStorage.setItem('isKYCVerified', 'true');
          setTimeout(() => { router.push("/dashboard"); }, 1500);
        };
        ```
    - `KYCComponent.tsx` (Data Handling - Disclosures):
        ```typescript
        disclosures: {
          minimumAge: 18,
          nationality: false,
          gender: false,
        }
        ```
    - `app/api/verify/route.ts` (Backend proof verification):
        ```typescript
        const result = await selfBackendVerifier.verify(attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData);
        if (!result.isValidDetails.isValid) { /* ... error handling ... */ }
        ```
- **Security Assessment**: The core flow of displaying a QR code, handling a successful callback, and redirecting is present. However, the reliance on `localStorage` for `isKYCVerified` is a client-side flag and is not inherently secure for critical access control, as it can be easily manipulated. This flag should ideally be backed by a secure session token or backend state that confirms the user's verified status. The hardcoded `userId` in `SelfAppBuilder` means the identity proof is not tied to the actual user of the application. The simulated "Facial Recognition" and "Register New Account" methods are not Self Protocol features and could confuse users or give a false sense of security if not clearly differentiated.

### 4. **Proof & Verification Functionality**
- **File Path**: `histo-bit-frontend/app/components/KYCComponent.tsx`, `histo-bit-frontend/app/api/verify/route.ts`
- **Implementation Quality**: Basic
- **Code Snippet**:
    - `KYCComponent.tsx` (Frontend disclosure request):
        ```typescript
        disclosures: {
          minimumAge: 18,
          nationality: false,
          gender: false,
        }
        ```
    - `app/api/verify/route.ts` (Backend verification config and processing):
        ```typescript
        const disclosures_config: VerificationConfig = {
            excludedCountries: [],
            ofac: false,
            minimumAge: 18,
        };
        // ...
        const result = await selfBackendVerifier.verify(attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData);
        // ...
        const saveOptions = (await configStore.getConfig(result.userData.userIdentifier)) as unknown as SelfAppDisclosureConfig;
        // ...
        verificationOptions: {
            minimumAge: saveOptions.minimumAge,
            ofac: saveOptions.ofac,
            excludedCountries: saveOptions.excludedCountries?.map(...)
        }
        ```
- **Security Assessment**: The `minimumAge: 18` disclosure is a standard ZKP-based age verification. The backend `VerificationConfig` includes `ofac: false` and `excludedCountries: []`, which are good placeholders for compliance, but they are not dynamically configured or actively used with specific country lists in this snippet. The `nationality: false, gender: false` in the frontend `disclosures` means these attributes are *not* requested for disclosure, which is a good privacy practice (data minimization), but also limits the utility of the identity proof for scenarios requiring these details. The discrepancy between frontend requested disclosures and backend configured verification parameters (e.g., frontend not requesting nationality/gender but backend having `excludedCountries`/`ofac` set to default `false`/`[]`) is minor but indicates a lack of full feature utilization or a need for better alignment.

### 5. **Advanced Self Features**
- **File Path**: `histo-bit-frontend/app/components/KYCComponent.tsx`, `histo-bit-frontend/app/api/verify/route.ts`
- **Implementation Quality**: None
- **Code Snippet**: No specific code snippets demonstrate advanced features like dynamic configuration based on user roles, multi-document support with different flows, or explicit nullifier management beyond what the SDK handles internally.
- **Security Assessment**: The codebase does not leverage advanced Self features. For example, dynamic configuration based on the `activeTab` (Patient, Doctor, etc.) in `KYCComponent.tsx` could lead to different `disclosures` being requested, but this is not implemented. Privacy features like selective disclosure are only partially utilized (`nationality: false`, `gender: false`). There's no explicit mention or implementation of identity nullifier handling or recovery mechanisms.

### 6. **Implementation Quality Assessment**
- **Architecture**: The separation of frontend components, API routes, and smart contracts is good. However, within the Self integration, the hardcoded `userId` is a critical architectural flaw. The inclusion of simulated "Facial Recognition" and "Register New Account" methods alongside the actual Self QR code without clear distinction in the code itself (beyond UI flow) is confusing and deviates from a clean architecture focused on Self Protocol.
- **Error Handling**: Basic `try-catch` and toast notifications are present. More granular error handling for specific Self SDK errors could improve user experience and debugging.
- **Privacy Protection**: The use of ZKPs for `minimumAge` is privacy-preserving. However, the general `isKYCVerified` flag in `localStorage` is not robust for privacy-sensitive access control.
- **Security**: The hardcoded `userId` is the most significant security weakness directly related to Self integration. Input validation for the `verify` API route is basic.
- **Testing**: No specific tests for Self Protocol integration are provided. The project's general "Missing tests" weakness applies here.
- **Documentation**: High-level mentions in `README.md` but lacking detailed Self-specific documentation.

## Self Integration Summary

### Features Used:
- **Self SDK methods**:
    - `SelfAppBuilder`: Used to configure the Self app for QR code generation.
    - `SelfQRcodeWrapper`: React component for displaying the QR code and handling verification callbacks.
    - `getUniversalLink`: Utility to generate universal links for direct app opening.
    - `SelfBackendVerifier`: Used on the backend to verify the ZKP proofs.
    - `DefaultConfigStore`, `AllIds`, `VerificationConfig` (from `@selfxyz/core`): Used for backend verifier configuration.
- **Configuration details**:
    - `version: 2`
    - `appName`, `scope`, `endpoint`: Loaded from environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT`).
    - `endpointType: "staging_celo"` (hardcoded).
    - `userIdType: "hex"` (hardcoded).
    - `userId`: **Hardcoded to "0xc060DbB08Cd8980479bFfe829236Bcb9a1D9bD06"**, which is a critical flaw.
    - `disclosures` (frontend): `minimumAge: 18`, `nationality: false`, `gender: false`.
    - `VerificationConfig` (backend): `minimumAge: 18`, `ofac: false`, `excludedCountries: []`.
- **Custom implementations or workarounds**: None specific to Self Protocol, but the project includes simulated "Facial Recognition" and "Register New Account" flows that are not Self Protocol integrations.

### Implementation Quality:
The Self Protocol integration is functional at a basic level, allowing a user to scan a QR code and receive a verification success/failure. The frontend components and backend API route are correctly structured to use the SDKs. However, the quality is severely hampered by the hardcoded `userId`, which makes the identity verification non-personal. The `isKYCVerified` flag stored in `localStorage` is not a secure mechanism for access control. Error handling is present but could be more robust. The distinction between actual Self integration and simulated features is not explicitly clear in the code's design.

### Best Practices Adherence:
- **Adherence**: Uses environment variables for sensitive Self configuration, uses official SDKs, implements basic `onSuccess`/`onError` callbacks.
- **Deviations**:
    - **Hardcoded `userId`**: This is a major deviation from best practices, as `userId` should dynamically correspond to the user initiating verification.
    - **Client-side `isKYCVerified` state**: Relying solely on `localStorage` for verification status is insecure.
    - **Limited disclosures**: While `nationality: false` and `gender: false` promote data minimization, the backend `VerificationConfig` has `ofac: false` and `excludedCountries: []` as defaults, which are not fully leveraged for compliance.
    - **Lack of dedicated testing**: Absence of unit or integration tests for Self-specific logic.
- **Innovative or exemplary approaches**: None observed in the Self Protocol integration itself.

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

-   **High Priority**:
    1.  **Dynamic `userId`**: The `userId` in `SelfAppBuilder` (`histo-bit-frontend/app/components/KYCComponent.tsx`) **MUST** be dynamically set to the connected wallet address of the current user. This is critical for the integrity of identity verification.
    2.  **Secure `isKYCVerified` State**: Implement a robust backend session management system to track `isKYCVerified` status. After successful verification, the backend should issue a secure token (e.g., JWT) to the frontend, which is then used for authenticated requests, rather than relying on a simple `localStorage` flag.
    3.  **Distinguish Simulated Features**: Clearly separate the UI/logic for actual Self Protocol integration from the simulated "Facial Recognition" and "Register New Account" features. Consider implementing actual biometric verification if intended, or remove them if they are mere placeholders to avoid misleading users.
    4.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Add unit and integration tests specifically for the Self Protocol integration, covering successful verification, various error scenarios, and edge cases.

-   **Medium Priority**:
    1.  **Enrich `disclosures`**: Depending on the application's needs, consider requesting more specific disclosures (e.g., `nationality`, `date_of_birth`) or implementing dynamic disclosure requests based on the selected `activeTab` (Patient, Doctor, etc.).
    2.  **Compliance Features**: Fully integrate `ofac` and `excludedCountries` checks in the `SelfBackendVerifier` by providing actual lists or dynamically configuring them based on business logic.
    3.  **Error Handling Improvement**: Provide more specific and user-friendly error messages for different Self Protocol verification failures.
    4.  **Self-specific Documentation**: Create dedicated documentation for the Self Protocol integration, including setup, configuration, and testing instructions.

-   **Low Priority**:
    1.  **User Context Data**: Leverage `userDefinedData` more effectively to pass session-specific or user-specific context from the frontend to the Self app, which can then be retrieved during backend verification.
    2.  **UI Feedback**: Enhance UI feedback during the verification process (e.g., polling status, progress indicators).

-   **Self-Specific**:
    1.  **On-chain Integration**: If the project's vision requires on-chain authorization based on Self proofs, explore extending a smart contract with `SelfVerificationRoot` or implementing a custom verification hook to validate Self attestations directly on-chain. This would provide a higher level of trust for smart contract interactions.
    2.  **Identity Recovery**: Investigate Self Protocol's identity recovery mechanisms to provide users with options to restore their identity if their device or Self app is lost.

## Technical Assessment from Senior Blockchain Developer Perspective

The Histo-Bit project presents a commendable effort to integrate Self Protocol for identity verification within a decentralized medical records system. From a senior blockchain developer's perspective, the use of Self SDKs for both frontend QR code generation and backend proof verification is correctly implemented at a fundamental level. However, the integration suffers from critical architectural and security flaws, most notably the hardcoded `userId`, which undermines the core principle of individual identity. The absence of direct on-chain contract integration with Self Protocol means that the smart contracts themselves do not natively trust Self attestations, limiting the depth of "decentralized identity" to an off-chain gatekeeping mechanism. While the project's overall structure is logical, the lack of comprehensive testing, CI/CD, and the presence of simulated features suggest that the Self integration is currently in a proof-of-concept stage rather than production-ready. Significant improvements are needed to ensure security, robustness, and the full realization of Self Protocol's capabilities.

## Project Analysis Summary

| GitHub Repository | Self Implementation | Senior Developer Rating (1-10) |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| https://github.com/SrJuanF/Histo-Bit | Basic Self Protocol SDK integration for off-chain KYC via QR code and backend proof verification. | 4.2/10 |

### Key Self Features Implemented:
- Feature 1: **Self App Configuration & QR Code Generation**: `SelfAppBuilder` and `SelfQRcodeWrapper` are used to create a Self app instance and display a scannable QR code. (Basic)
- Feature 2: **Backend Proof Verification**: `SelfBackendVerifier` is utilized in a Next.js API route to validate zero-knowledge proofs received from the Self app. (Intermediate)
- Feature 3: **Minimum Age Disclosure**: The system requests `minimumAge: 18` as a disclosure, leveraging ZKP for privacy-preserving age verification. (Basic)

### Technical Assessment:
The Self Protocol integration is a basic, functional implementation for off-chain KYC. While it correctly uses the SDKs, the hardcoded `userId` is a critical flaw rendering individual identity verification ineffective. The absence of direct smart contract integration with Self Protocol and the reliance on client-side state for verification status limit its security and decentralization, indicating a need for significant architectural and security enhancements for production readiness.
