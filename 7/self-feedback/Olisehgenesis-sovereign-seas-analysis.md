## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Self SDK Integration Quality | 6.5/10 | SDKs are imported and basic functions used. However, there are inconsistencies in `SelfAppBuilder` configuration across files and a critical bug (`ethers.constants.AddressZero` for `userId`) in one implementation. Good handling of SSR issues. |
| Contract Integration | 0/10 | No direct integration with Self Protocol Solidity contracts (e.g., `SelfVerificationRoot`). The project uses the `SelfBackendVerifier` SDK, which abstracts away direct contract calls. |
| Identity Verification Implementation | 5.0/10 | `SelfQRcodeWrapper` and `getUniversalLink` are used for frontend flow. Backend `SelfBackendVerifier` handles proof validation. Significant flaws: `ethers.constants.AddressZero` for `userId` in one place, and use of a deprecated API endpoint (`/api/save-verify`) in another. The `profile/page.tsx` implementation is correct. |
| Proof Functionality | 7.0/10 | The core `SelfBackendVerifier.verify()` call correctly handles ZKP validation and attestation processing. `AllIds` supports multi-document types. The project correctly extracts `nationality` and `userDefinedData` from the verified output. |
| Code Quality & Architecture | 6.0/10 | Backend architecture for Self is decent, but frontend implementations are inconsistent and contain critical bugs/outdated API usage. Lack of dedicated tests and documentation for Self features. Overly permissive CORS. |
| **Overall Technical Score** | 5.9/10 | The core backend integration is functional and uses advanced SDK features like `RedisConfigStore`. However, critical frontend bugs (hardcoded `userId`, deprecated API usage) and inconsistencies significantly reduce the score. The absence of direct contract integration and dedicated tests also limits the depth of integration. |

## Project Summary
-   **Primary purpose/goal related to Self Protocol**: To enable identity verification for users within the Sovereign Seas platform, likely for anti-Sybil protection or eligibility for specific campaigns/features. The `claim-vote.ts` API route explicitly checks for Self or GoodDollar verification before allowing a user to claim a vote.
-   **Problem solved for identity verification users/developers**: Provides a privacy-preserving, decentralized identity verification mechanism for users (via Self Protocol) and a backend system for developers to integrate this verification into their application logic. It aims to prevent Sybil attacks and ensure fair participation.
-   **Target users/beneficiaries within privacy-preserving identity space**: Users of the Sovereign Seas platform who need to prove their unique identity without revealing excessive personal data. Developers who want to integrate a robust, privacy-focused identity solution into their dApps.

## Technology Stack
-   **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (89.93%), Solidity (8.48%)
-   **Self-specific libraries and frameworks used**:
    *   `@selfxyz/core` (1.0.7-beta.1)
    *   `@selfxyz/qrcode` (1.0.10-beta.1)
    *   `@selfxyz/common` (0.0.6)
-   **Smart contract standards and patterns used**: OpenZeppelin (ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard) for core contracts, but no Self-specific contract standards are implemented by the project.
-   **Frontend/backend technologies supporting Self integration**:
    *   **Frontend**: React (18), Next.js (15.0.3), Wagmi (2.14), Viem (2.21), Privy (for wallet auth), Framer Motion.
    *   **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Redis (for config and verification storage), `SelfBackendVerifier` from `@selfxyz/core`.

## Architecture and Structure
-   **Overall project structure**: A monorepo-like structure with `frame/` for Farcaster frames and `selfback/selfauth/` for the identity verification backend/frontend. The `v4.2/` directory seems to be the main dApp frontend.
-   **Key components and their Self interactions**:
    *   **`selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`**: The central backend API endpoint for receiving and processing Self Protocol proofs. It uses `SelfBackendVerifier` to validate proofs and stores results in Redis.
    *   **`selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` (frontend)**: A dedicated page for displaying the Self QR code.
    *   **`v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx` (frontend)**: The main user profile page that integrates the Self QR code for verification and displays verification status.
    *   **`selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify-details.ts`**: API endpoint to retrieve combined Self and GoodDollar verification status from Redis.
    *   **`selfback/selfauth/pages/api/claim-vote.ts`**: API endpoint that gates access to voting based on Self or GoodDollar verification status.
    *   **`selfback/selfauth/lib/init-middleware.ts`**: CORS middleware for API routes.
    *   **`selfback/selfauth/pages/status.tsx`**: A debug/status page to show verification details.
-   **Smart contract architecture (Self-related contracts)**: No custom Solidity contracts directly extending or interacting with Self Protocol's on-chain components are provided by this project. The integration is purely off-chain using the Self SDK.
-   **Self integration approach (SDK vs direct contracts)**: Primarily SDK-based for both frontend and backend. The `SelfBackendVerifier` handles the cryptographic heavy lifting and interaction with Self's off-chain infrastructure and on-chain roots.

## Security Analysis
-   **Self-specific security patterns**:
    *   **`SelfBackendVerifier`**: This SDK component is designed to securely verify zero-knowledge proofs. Its usage is a best practice for off-chain proof validation.
    *   **`RedisConfigStore`**: Allows for dynamic configuration of verification requirements, which can be a security feature if managed correctly (e.g., changing `excludedCountries` or `ofac` checks).
-   **Input validation for verification parameters**: The `pages/api/verify.ts` endpoint performs basic checks for the presence of `proof`, `publicSignals`, `attestationId`, and `userContextData`.
-   **Privacy protection mechanisms**:
    *   Self Protocol itself is privacy-preserving by using ZKPs. The project extracts `nationality` and `userDefinedData` which are part of the disclosure.
    *   **Concern**: Storing `nationality`, `attestationId`, `userDefinedData`, and `walletAddress` in plain JSON within Redis (as seen in `saveVerificationData` in `pages/api/verify.ts`) could be a privacy risk if the Redis instance itself is not sufficiently secured (e.g., no encryption at rest, accessible from public networks without strong authentication).
-   **Identity data validation**: The `SelfBackendVerifier` handles the underlying zero-knowledge proof validation of the identity data within the ZKP. The project's backend doesn't add further semantic validation beyond this.
-   **Transaction security for Self operations**: Not directly applicable as Self operations are off-chain proof submissions. However, the `claim-vote.ts` endpoint uses `viem` to simulate and execute on-chain transactions only after successful identity verification, which is a good pattern.

## Functionality & Correctness
-   **Self core functionalities implemented**:
    *   Frontend: QR code display, universal link generation.
    *   Backend: Proof reception, `SelfBackendVerifier.verify()` for ZKP validation, extraction of disclosed attributes (`nationality`, `userDefinedData`), and storage of verification status.
-   **Verification execution correctness**: The core logic using `SelfBackendVerifier.verify()` appears correct. However, inconsistencies in frontend `SelfAppBuilder` configurations (different `scope`, different `userId` logic, different `disclosures`) and the use of a deprecated API endpoint (`/api/save-verify`) in `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx` indicate potential correctness issues in certain user flows. The `userId: ethers.constants.AddressZero` in `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` is a critical bug that would make verification non-specific to individual users.
-   **Error handling for Self operations**: Basic `try-catch` blocks are present on both frontend and backend. Backend returns meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.
-   **Edge case handling for identity verification**: Not explicitly detailed in the snippets, but the `RedisConfigStore` provides a fallback to `verification_config` if a specific user's config isn't found.
-   **Testing strategy for Self features**: No dedicated test files for Self Protocol integration were provided.

## Code Quality & Architecture
-   **Code organization for Self features**: Self-related code is primarily concentrated in `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts` (backend) and `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx` (frontend for actual usage). The `RedisConfigStore` is a good architectural choice for managing dynamic configurations. However, the presence of multiple, slightly different `verify.tsx` files and an unused/deprecated API endpoint (`verify-save.ts`) suggests some disorganization or leftover code.
-   **Documentation quality for Self integration**: Minimal. Comments are sparse. No high-level architectural documentation for how Self Protocol fits into the overall system.
-   **Naming conventions for Self-related components**: Consistent with Self SDK naming (e.g., `SelfAppBuilder`, `SelfQRcodeWrapper`, `SelfBackendVerifier`).
-   **Complexity management in verification logic**: The `SelfBackendVerifier` abstracts away much of the complexity, making the project's direct integration relatively straightforward. The `RedisConfigStore` adds a layer of flexibility without excessive complexity.

## Dependencies & Setup
-   **Self SDK and library management**: `package.json` clearly lists `@selfxyz/core`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`, `@selfxyz/common`.
-   **Installation process for Self dependencies**: Standard `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
-   **Configuration approach for Self networks**: The `endpoint` is hardcoded to `https://selfauth.vercel.app/api/verify`. There's no explicit multi-network (e.g., testnet/mainnet) configuration for Self Protocol itself, though the broader project uses `VITE_ENV` for Celo chains. The `SelfBackendVerifier` is initialized with `false` for production mode, which is important for security in a real production environment.
-   **Deployment considerations for Self integration**: The `next.config.ts` handles SSR issues for `@selfxyz/qrcode`. The backend is designed as a Next.js API route, suitable for serverless deployment (e.g., Vercel). CORS is overly permissive (`*`), which is a security concern for production.

## Self Protocol Integration Analysis

### 1. **Self SDK Usage**
-   **File Path**: `selfback/selfauth/package.json`, `selfback/selfauth/next.config.ts`, `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx`, `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx`, `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx`
-   **Implementation Quality**: Intermediate/Basic
-   **Code Snippet**:
    *   `import '@selfxyz/core'`
    *   `import '@selfxyz/qrcode'`
    *   `new SelfAppBuilder({ appName: "Sovereign Seas", scope: "seasv2", endpoint: "https://selfauth.vercel.app/api/verify", userId: address, userIdType: "hex", disclosures: { nationality: true, minimumAge: 18, gender: true, excludedCountries: [], ofac: false } }).build();` (`v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx`)
    *   `<SelfQRcodeWrapper selfApp={selfApp} onSuccess={handleVerificationSuccess} onError={onError} />`
-   **Security Assessment**: The use of beta SDK versions indicates active development, but also potential for breaking changes or undiscovered issues. The `next.config.ts` workaround for SSR issues is a good practice. However, the `userId: ethers.constants.AddressZero` in `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` is a critical flaw, as it means all verifications would be linked to a single, non-unique identity. The `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx` correctly uses the connected `address` for `userId`. Inconsistent `scope` values (`seasv2` vs `sovereign-seas`) and `disclosures` across different `SelfAppBuilder` instances could lead to unexpected behavior.

### 2. **Contract Integration**
-   **File Path**: N/A
-   **Implementation Quality**: 0/10 (Not applicable)
-   **Code Snippet**: N/A
-   **Security Assessment**: The project does not directly interact with Self Protocol's Solidity contracts. All Self Protocol-related logic is handled off-chain via the SDK, which then interfaces with Self's infrastructure and on-chain roots. This is a valid integration pattern, but it means there's no custom contract logic extending Self's on-chain features.

### 3. **Identity Verification Implementation**
-   **File Path**: `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx`, `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx`, `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx`, `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`, `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify-details.ts`, `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/claim-vote.ts`
-   **Implementation Quality**: Basic/Intermediate
-   **Code Snippet**:
    *   `const app = new SelfAppBuilder(...).build();`
    *   `setUniversalLink(getUniversalLink(app));`
    *   `<SelfQRcodeWrapper selfApp={selfApp} onSuccess={handleVerificationSuccess} onError={onError} />`
    *   `const result = await selfBackendVerifier.verify(attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData);` (`selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`)
    *   `const walletAddress = result.userData.userIdentifier;` (`selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`)
    *   `await client.set(key, JSON.stringify(data));` (Redis storage in `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`)
    *   `const isSelfVerified = await isWalletVerified(beneficiaryAddress);` (`selfback/selfauth/pages/api/claim-vote.ts`)
-   **Security Assessment**: The basic flow of QR code generation and backend proof validation is present. However, the `userId: ethers.constants.AddressZero` bug in `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` is a critical vulnerability as it would allow any user to claim a verification, effectively bypassing identity checks. The `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx` attempts to use `uuidv4` for `userId` but then calls a deprecated `/api/save-verify` endpoint, which is also a major flaw. The `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx` implements the flow correctly by using the connected wallet `address` as `userId` and calls the correct `/api/verify` endpoint. Privacy is a concern with plain Redis storage without encryption.

### 4. **Proof & Verification Functionality**
-   **File Path**: `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`
-   **Implementation Quality**: Intermediate/Advanced
-   **Code Snippet**:
    *   `const verification_config = { minimumAge: 18, nationality: true, gender: true, excludedCountries: [], ofac: false };`
    *   `const selfBackendVerifier = new SelfBackendVerifier("seasv2", "https://selfauth.vercel.app/api/verify", false, AllIds, configStore, "hex");`
    *   `const result = await selfBackendVerifier.verify(attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData);`
    *   `if (result.isValidDetails.isValid) { ... const filteredSubject = { ...result.discloseOutput }; ... nationality: filteredSubject.nationality ... }`
-   **Security Assessment**: The `SelfBackendVerifier` handles the cryptographic validation, ensuring zero-knowledge proof validity and document authenticity. The use of `AllIds` allows for multiple document types. The project correctly extracts disclosed attributes like `nationality`. The `RedisConfigStore` allows for dynamic adjustment of `minimumAge`, `ofac`, and `excludedCountries`, which are critical for compliance. The `ofac: false` and `excludedCountries: []` are default settings; stricter policies would require configuration.

### 5. **Advanced Self Features**
-   **File Path**: `selfback/selfauth/pages/api/verify.ts`
-   **Implementation Quality**: Advanced
-   **Code Snippet**:
    *   `export class RedisConfigStore implements IConfigStorage { ... }`
    *   `const configStore = new RedisConfigStore();`
    *   `selfBackendVerifier = new SelfBackendVerifier(..., AllIds, configStore, ...);`
    *   `let saveOptions: VerificationConfig; try { saveOptions = await configStore.getConfig(result.userData.userIdentifier); } catch { ... saveOptions = verification_config; }`
-   **Security Assessment**: The `RedisConfigStore` is an excellent example of leveraging Self Protocol's flexibility to implement dynamic verification requirements. This allows for context-aware disclosures and can be updated without redeploying the backend. `AllIds` provides multi-document support. Privacy is partially addressed by Self's ZKP nature, but the storage of extracted PII in Redis without encryption is a concern. Compliance features (`ofac`, `excludedCountries`) are configurable. No identity recovery mechanisms are observed.

### 6. **Implementation Quality Assessment**
-   **Architecture**: The backend's use of `SelfBackendVerifier` with a custom `RedisConfigStore` is modular and well-designed for a scalable identity service. However, the disjointed and inconsistent frontend implementations for Self verification (multiple `verify.tsx` files, one with a critical bug, another using a deprecated API) indicate a lack of cohesive architectural oversight for the frontend integration.
-   **Error Handling**: Backend error handling is robust with specific HTTP status codes and detailed logging. Frontend error handling is basic but present.
-   **Privacy Protection**: While Self Protocol is privacy-preserving, the storage of extracted `nationality` and `userDefinedData` in an unsecured Redis instance is a potential privacy vulnerability.
-   **Security**: The core cryptographic verification is handled by the SDK. However, the overly permissive CORS policy (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) and the `userId` bug in one frontend implementation are significant security flaws.
-   **Testing**: No dedicated tests for Self Protocol features are provided in the digest.
-   **Documentation**: Inline comments are minimal. No comprehensive documentation exists for the Self Protocol integration, which would be crucial given the inconsistencies.

## Self Integration Summary

### Features Used:
-   **Self SDKs**: `@selfxyz/core` (1.0.7-beta.1), `@selfxyz/qrcode` (1.0.10-beta.1)
-   **Frontend**:
    *   `SelfAppBuilder`: Used to configure the Self app with `appName`, `scope` (`seasv2` or `sovereign-seas`), `endpoint` (`https://selfauth.vercel.app/api/verify`), `userId` (connected wallet address or UUID), `userIdType` (`hex`), and `disclosures` (`nationality`, `minimumAge`, `gender`, `ofac`, `excludedCountries`).
    *   `getUniversalLink`: Generates deep links for mobile Self app redirection.
    *   `SelfQRcodeWrapper`: Renders the QR code for desktop scanning.
-   **Backend**:
    *   `SelfBackendVerifier`: Core component for validating ZK proofs received from the Self app. Configured with `scope`, `endpoint`, production mode (`false`), `AllIds` (for document types), and a `RedisConfigStore`.
    *   `RedisConfigStore`: Custom implementation of `IConfigStorage` to store and retrieve `VerificationConfig` (disclosures) in Redis, enabling dynamic configuration.
    *   **Verification Process**: The backend `verify` API endpoint receives `attestationId`, `proof`, `publicSignals`, `userContextData`, validates them, extracts `walletAddress` and `nationality`, and saves the verification status to Redis.
    *   **Status Retrieval**: The `verify` API (GET) and `verify-details` API retrieve stored Self (and GoodDollar) verification data from Redis.
    *   **Access Control**: The `claim-vote` API endpoint checks for Self or GoodDollar verification before allowing a user to proceed.

### Implementation Quality:
-   **Code organization**: Generally good separation of concerns between frontend and backend. The `RedisConfigStore` is a good pattern. However, the presence of multiple, inconsistent `verify.tsx` files and an unused/deprecated API endpoint (`/api/save-verify`) indicates some technical debt or lack of cleanup.
-   **Error handling**: Decent `try-catch` blocks and specific error messages on the backend. Frontend has basic callbacks.
-   **Security practices**: `SelfBackendVerifier` is a secure way to handle ZKP validation. The `RedisConfigStore` adds flexibility. However, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in `next.config.ts` and `pages/api/verify.ts` is overly permissive for a production environment. Storing potentially sensitive PII (nationality, userDefinedData) in Redis without explicit mention of encryption is a concern if the Redis instance itself isn't secured. A critical bug in `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` uses `ethers.constants.AddressZero` as `userId`, rendering verifications non-specific.
-   **Architectural decisions**: The use of a dedicated backend API endpoint for Self verification and a custom Redis store for configuration is a sound architectural choice for flexibility and scalability.

### Best Practices Adherence:
-   **SDK Usage**: Adheres to SDK usage patterns for `SelfAppBuilder`, `getUniversalLink`, and `SelfQRcodeWrapper`.
-   **Backend Verification**: Correctly uses `SelfBackendVerifier` for cryptographic proof validation.
-   **Inconsistencies**: Deviations include the `userId` bug in `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` and the use of a deprecated API endpoint in `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx`. Disclosures are also inconsistent across different frontend `SelfAppBuilder` instances.
-   **CORS**: Overly permissive CORS configuration is a significant deviation from best practices for production security.
-   **Innovative approaches**: The `RedisConfigStore` for dynamic disclosure configuration is an innovative and exemplary approach to leverage Self Protocol's flexibility.

## Recommendations for Improvement

-   **High Priority**:
    1.  **Fix `userId` bug in `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx`**: Ensure `SelfAppBuilder` uses a unique, user-specific identifier (like the connected wallet address or a UUID) for `userId` to correctly link verifications to individual users. The `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx` already implements this correctly.
    2.  **Consolidate Frontend Verification Flows**: Remove redundant or outdated `verify.tsx` files (e.g., `selfback/selfauth/pages/verify.tsx` and `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx`). Standardize on a single, correct implementation (like the one in `v4.2/src/pages/app/profile/page.tsx`).
    3.  **Address Deprecated API Endpoint**: Update `v4.2/src/pages/app/verify/page.tsx` to use the correct `/api/verify` endpoint instead of the deprecated `/api/save-verify`.
    4.  **Harden CORS Policy**: Restrict `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to only the known frontend domains (e.g., `https://sovereignseas.xyz`, `https://app.sovereignseas.xyz`) instead of `*`. This is critical for production security.
    5.  **Secure Redis Data**: Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in Redis (e.g., `nationality`, `userDefinedData`). Ensure Redis itself is password-protected and not publicly exposed.
    6.  **Inconsistent Disclosures**: Standardize the `disclosures` configuration across all `SelfAppBuilder` instances to ensure consistent verification requirements.

-   **Medium Priority**:
    1.  **Add Self-specific Unit and Integration Tests**: Implement tests for the `RedisConfigStore` and the `pages/api/verify.ts` endpoint to ensure correctness and resilience of the Self integration.
    2.  **Improve Frontend User Feedback**: Provide clearer loading states, success messages, and specific error messages to the user during the Self verification process.
    3.  **Implement Selective Disclosure UI**: Allow users to choose which attributes they want to disclose (if applicable to the use case) on the frontend, and reflect this in the `disclosures` configuration.
    4.  **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the `/api/verify` endpoint to prevent abuse.
    5.  **Document Self Integration**: Create dedicated documentation for the Self Protocol integration, explaining the flow, configuration, and security considerations.

-   **Low Priority**:
    1.  **Refine `userDefinedData` Usage**: Consider structuring `userDefinedData` more formally (e.g., as a JSON object) to pass more specific context from the frontend to the backend, rather than just a simple string.
    2.  **Version Management for Self SDKs**: Ensure a clear strategy for updating beta versions of the SDKs to stable releases when available.
    3.  **Detailed Logging**: Enhance backend logging to capture more details about verification attempts and outcomes, useful for auditing and debugging.

## Technical Assessment from Senior Blockchain Developer Perspective

The project demonstrates a foundational understanding of integrating Self Protocol for identity verification, particularly through its well-structured backend API (`/api/verify.ts`) and the innovative `RedisConfigStore` for dynamic disclosure requirements. This backend component is robust and correctly leverages the `SelfBackendVerifier` for cryptographic proof validation. However, the overall implementation is hampered by critical inconsistencies and bugs in the frontend components (e.g., hardcoded `userId` to `AddressZero` and using deprecated API endpoints, differing scopes and disclosures across various frontend files). The permissive CORS policy is a significant security oversight for a production environment. While the project correctly identifies a strong use case for decentralized identity (anti-Sybil protection for voting), the current state of frontend integration and lack of dedicated testing for Self features indicate that it is not yet production-ready without addressing these high-priority issues. The absence of direct Solidity contract integration with Self Protocol also suggests a more off-chain-focused approach, which is valid but limits the depth of on-chain identity management.

|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| https://github.com/Olisehgenesis/sovereign-seas | Implements Self Protocol for off-chain identity verification using `@selfxyz/core` and `@selfxyz/qrcode` SDKs, with a custom Redis-backed configuration store for dynamic disclosure requirements. Used for anti-Sybil checks before voting. | 5.9/10 |

### Key Self Features Implemented:
-   **SelfAppBuilder & SelfQRcodeWrapper**: Used for frontend QR code generation and universal link creation. (Intermediate/Basic due to inconsistencies and `AddressZero` bug)
-   **SelfBackendVerifier**: Utilized on the backend for secure, off-chain zero-knowledge proof validation. (Advanced)
-   **RedisConfigStore (IConfigStorage)**: Custom implementation for dynamic verification configuration (e.g., `minimumAge`, `nationality`). (Advanced)
-   **Identity Verification Gateway**: Backend API (`/api/verify`) acts as the endpoint for Self app, processing proofs and storing results. (Intermediate)
-   **Identity Proof Gating**: `claim-vote` API checks for Self verification before allowing a user action. (Intermediate)

### Technical Assessment:
The project features a technically sound backend for Self Protocol integration, showcasing advanced SDK usage with a custom Redis configuration store. However, critical frontend bugs (like hardcoding `userId` to `AddressZero` and using deprecated API endpoints) and inconsistent `SelfAppBuilder` configurations across different pages severely undermine its reliability and production readiness. The overly permissive CORS policy also poses a significant security risk. Addressing these high-priority issues is crucial for a viable and secure decentralized identity solution.
