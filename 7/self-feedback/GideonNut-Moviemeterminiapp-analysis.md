## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|:---------|:-------------|:--------------|
| Self SDK Integration Quality | 0.0/10 | No Self Protocol SDKs (`@selfxyz/qrcode`, `@selfxyz/core`) were found in the codebase. The project uses `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` which is unrelated to Self Protocol. |
| Contract Integration | 0.0/10 | No evidence of direct interaction with Self Protocol smart contracts (`SelfVerificationRoot` or others) was found. The project interacts with a custom `VOTE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` on Celo. |
| Identity Verification Implementation | 0.0/10 | No Self Protocol-specific identity verification flows, QR code integration, or data handling mechanisms were implemented. Identity is primarily handled via Farcaster FID and wallet address. |
| Proof Functionality | 0.0/10 | No implementation of Self Protocol proof types (e.g., age, geographic restrictions, OFAC) or attestation types (e.g., electronic passport, EU ID card) was found. |
| Code Quality & Architecture | 6.5/10 | (General assessment, as Self-specific quality is N/A). The project has a clear Next.js/React structure, uses Shadcn UI, and MongoDB for data. Good separation of concerns for API routes and components. However, it lacks a dedicated testing suite and CI/CD, and some security warnings are present in Farcaster setup. |
| **Overall Technical Score** | 1.0/10 | The project demonstrates basic web3 integration with Farcaster and Celo, but its score for Self Protocol integration is effectively zero due to the complete absence of any Self Protocol-related features. The general code quality is moderate, but this analysis is focused on Self Protocol. |

## Project Summary
-   **Primary purpose/goal related to Self Protocol**: The project, MovieMeter, is a Farcaster Mini App for movie voting and rewards. It does **not** have a primary purpose or goal related to Self Protocol, as no Self Protocol integration was found.
-   **Problem solved for identity verification users/developers**: The project does **not** solve problems for identity verification users or developers using Self Protocol, as it does not integrate Self Protocol. It uses Farcaster FIDs and wallet addresses for user identification.
-   **Target users/beneficiaries within privacy-preserving identity space**: The project does **not** target users or beneficiaries within the privacy-preserving identity space using Self Protocol. Its identity model is tied to Farcaster and blockchain addresses, which are not inherently privacy-preserving in the way Self Protocol aims to be.

## Technology Stack
-   **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (88.05%), JavaScript (11.41%), CSS (0.54%).
-   **Self-specific libraries and frameworks used**: None.
-   **Smart contract standards and patterns used**: Custom Solidity contract for movie voting (identified by `VOTE_CONTRACT_ABI`), deployed on Celo. Uses `viem` for contract interaction.
-   **Frontend/backend technologies supporting Self integration**: Next.js (frontend/backend API routes), React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI. MongoDB with Mongoose for database. Farcaster Client API integration. Wagmi and Ethers.js for wallet interaction.

## Architecture and Structure
-   **Overall project structure**: Standard Next.js application with a `src` directory containing `app` (pages and API routes), `components`, `lib` (utilities, database, Farcaster API), `constants`, and `data`.
-   **Key components and their Self interactions**: No components or interactions related to Self Protocol were found. Key components include React pages for Discover, Movies, TV Shows, Leaderboards, Rewards, Watchlist, and Admin. API routes handle movie data, votes, comments, watchlist, and TMDB imports. Farcaster integration is handled via `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` and a custom Farcaster API client (`src/lib/farcaster.ts`).
-   **Smart contract architecture (Self-related contracts)**: No Self Protocol-related smart contract architecture was found. The project uses a custom `VoteContract` on Celo to record movie votes.
-   **Self integration approach (SDK vs direct contracts)**: No Self Protocol integration approach (neither SDK nor direct contracts) was found.

## Security Analysis
-   **Self-specific security patterns**: None, as Self Protocol is not integrated.
-   **Input validation for verification parameters**: No Self Protocol verification parameters are handled. General input validation is present in API routes (e.g., `src/app/api/comments/route.ts` for content length).
-   **Privacy protection mechanisms**: No Self Protocol-specific privacy mechanisms (like selective disclosure or nullifiers) are implemented. The project relies on Farcaster's and blockchain's inherent privacy properties (pseudonymity of addresses).
-   **Identity data validation**: Farcaster FIDs are validated by the Farcaster API. Wallet addresses are used directly. No Self Protocol identity data validation is performed.
-   **Transaction security for Self operations**: No Self Protocol operations are performed. Blockchain transactions for voting use Wagmi's `useWriteContract` hook, which handles signing and sending transactions securely via the connected wallet. The `FARCASTER_SETUP.md` file explicitly warns about private keys being exposed in the browser for Farcaster API authentication, which is a significant security concern for that specific integration.

## Functionality & Correctness
-   **Self core functionalities implemented**: None.
-   **Verification execution correctness**: Not applicable, as no Self Protocol verification is implemented.
-   **Error handling for Self operations**: Not applicable.
-   **Edge case handling for identity verification**: Not applicable.
-   **Testing strategy for Self features**: Not applicable. The codebase generally lacks a dedicated test suite, as noted in the GitHub metrics.

## Code Quality & Architecture
-   **Code organization for Self features**: No Self features, so no organization for them.
-   **Documentation quality for Self integration**: No Self integration, so no documentation. General documentation includes a comprehensive `README.md` and `FARCASTER_SETUP.md`.
-   **Naming conventions for Self-related components**: No Self-related components.
-   **Complexity management in verification logic**: No Self Protocol verification logic.

## Dependencies & Setup
-   **Self SDK and library management**: No Self SDKs or libraries are managed.
-   **Installation process for Self dependencies**: No Self dependencies.
-   **Configuration approach for Self networks**: No Self networks are configured. The project configures Celo (mainnet and Alfajores testnet) for smart contract interactions.
-   **Deployment considerations for Self integration**: No Self integration deployment considerations. The project focuses on Vercel deployment and Farcaster Mini App manifest generation.

## Self Protocol Integration Analysis

Based on a thorough review of the provided code digest, there is **no evidence of Self Protocol integration**. The project does not import any `@selfxyz` SDKs, implement any `SelfVerificationRoot` contracts, or utilize any Self Protocol-specific identity verification or proof mechanisms.

The project is a Farcaster Mini App with web3 interactions primarily focused on the Celo blockchain for movie voting. Its identity management revolves around Farcaster FIDs and user wallet addresses.

### 1. Self SDK Usage
-   **Evidence**: No import statements for `@selfxyz/qrcode` or `@selfxyz/core` were found. The only Farcaster-related SDK is `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk`, used in `src/components/FarcasterReady.tsx` for `sdk.actions.ready()`.
-   **Implementation Quality**: N/A (0.0/10) - No Self SDK usage.
-   **Security Assessment**: N/A

### 2. Contract Integration
-   **Evidence**: No interaction with Self Protocol contract addresses (Mainnet: `0xe57F4773bd9c9d8b6Cd70431117d353298B9f5BF`, Testnet: `0x68c931C9a534D37aa78094877F46fE46a49F1A51`) was found. The project defines and interacts with a custom `VOTE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` on Celo. There is no implementation of `SelfVerificationRoot` or its methods like `customVerificationHook()` or `getConfigId()`.
-   **Implementation Quality**: N/A (0.0/10) - No Self contract integration.
-   **Security Assessment**: N/A

### 3. Identity Verification Implementation
-   **Evidence**: No Self Protocol-specific QR code integration (`SelfQRcodeWrapper`), `SelfAppBuilder` configuration, or universal link implementation for Self Protocol was found. The identity verification flow is based on Farcaster authentication and wallet connection (Wagmi).
-   **Implementation Quality**: N/A (0.0/10) - No Self identity verification.
-   **Security Assessment**: N/A

### 4. Proof & Verification Functionality
-   **Evidence**: No implementation of Self Protocol proof types (e.g., age verification, geographic restrictions, OFAC compliance) or attestation types (e.g., electronic passport, EU ID card) was found. The project's "proof" involves a user signing a transaction to vote on a movie, which is a standard blockchain transaction, not a zero-knowledge proof or document authenticity check via Self Protocol.
-   **Implementation Quality**: N/A (0.0/10) - No Self proof functionality.
-   **Security Assessment**: N/A

### 5. Advanced Self Features
-   **Evidence**: None of the advanced Self features such as dynamic configuration, multi-document support, selective disclosure, nullifier management, compliance integration, or recovery mechanisms were found.
-   **Implementation Quality**: N/A (0.0/10) - No advanced Self features.
-   **Security Assessment**: N/A

### 6. Implementation Quality Assessment (General, as Self-specific is N/A)
-   **Architecture**: The project has a clear Next.js/React architecture with well-defined API routes and components. Modular design is generally followed.
-   **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is present in API routes and frontend components (e.g., `try-catch` blocks, `alert` messages). However, it could be more robust with centralized error logging or user-friendly toast notifications instead of basic alerts.
-   **Privacy Protection**: Not applicable for Self Protocol. For general privacy, user addresses are truncated in the UI.
-   **Security**: The Farcaster API setup explicitly warns about exposing private keys in the browser (`FARCASTER_SETUP.md`), which is a critical security vulnerability for production environments. While the project uses `next-auth` for Farcaster sign-in, the manual Farcaster API client in `src/lib/farcaster.ts` is still configured with public/private keys from environment variables, which, if `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed, would be exposed. Input validation is present for comments and movie data, but a comprehensive security audit would be needed.
-   **Testing**: As noted in GitHub metrics, there is no dedicated test suite. This is a significant weakness for any production-ready application.
-   **Documentation**: Good `README.md` and `FARCASTER_SETUP.md` provide clear setup and usage instructions. Code comments are present but could be more extensive for complex logic.

## Self Integration Summary

### Features Used:
-   **No Self Protocol SDK methods, contracts, or features were implemented.**
-   The project utilizes `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` for Farcaster Mini App readiness, `next-auth` with `CredentialsProvider` for Farcaster sign-in, and `wagmi` for Celo blockchain interactions.

### Implementation Quality:
-   **Code organization and architectural decisions**: The project is reasonably well-organized for a Next.js application, with clear separation between frontend components, API routes, and utility functions.
-   **Error handling and edge case management**: Basic error handling is implemented, but could be improved. Wallet connection and network switching errors are handled with alerts and status messages.
-   **Security practices and potential vulnerabilities**: A major security concern is the exposure of Farcaster private keys to the browser if `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` is used, as warned in `FARCASTER_SETUP.md`. This could lead to compromise of the Farcaster app key. This needs immediate remediation for any production deployment.

### Best Practices Adherence:
-   **Deviations from recommended patterns**: The Farcaster private key exposure is a significant deviation from security best practices for handling sensitive credentials.
-   **Innovative or exemplary approaches**: The project's core idea of a Farcaster Mini App for movie voting on Celo is a good use case for web3 social applications. The integration of TMDB for movie data and MongoDB for persistence is well-structured.

## Recommendations for Improvement
-   **High Priority**:
    1.  **Self Protocol Integration**: If Self Protocol integration is a project goal, it must be explicitly added. This would involve:
        *   Installing `@selfxyz/core` and/or `@selfxyz/qrcode`.
        *   Designing a user flow for identity verification (e.g., age verification before voting on certain movies, or country verification for rewards).
        *   Implementing SDK methods for QR code generation, identity discovery, and proof requests.
        *   Developing backend logic to verify Self proofs.
        *   Potentially extending a `SelfVerificationRoot` contract if on-chain verification is desired.
    2.  **Farcaster Private Key Security**: Migrate Farcaster API authentication to a server-side only approach, or use a secure proxy, to prevent exposure of `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` in the browser. This is critical.
    3.  **Test Suite**: Implement a comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end tests) for all critical functionalities, especially smart contract interactions and API routes.
-   **Medium Priority**:
    1.  **Improved Error Handling UI**: Replace basic `alert()` calls with more user-friendly toast notifications or dedicated error display components.
    2.  **Smart Contract Sync**: The `syncContentToContract` function in `src/app/admin/page.tsx` currently only logs the syncing process. It needs to implement actual calls to the `addMovie` function on the Celo smart contract.
    3.  **Gas Estimation**: In `src/app/movies/page.tsx` and `src/app/movies/[id]/page.tsx`, the `gas: 150000n` is a fixed conservative estimate. While it works, `viem` can estimate gas automatically, which is generally more robust: `gas: await publicClient.estimateGas(...)`.
-   **Low Priority**:
    1.  **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement CI/CD to automate testing and deployment processes.
    2.  **Configuration Examples**: Provide more detailed configuration file examples.
    3.  **Containerization**: Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for easier deployment and environment consistency.
    4.  **Community Adoption**: Engage with the community to gather feedback and drive adoption.

## Technical Assessment from Senior Blockchain Developer Perspective
The project, MovieMeter, is a functional Farcaster Mini App with a well-structured Next.js codebase and integration with the Celo blockchain for movie voting. The use of Wagmi for wallet interactions and MongoDB for data persistence demonstrates a solid foundation in web3 development. However, from a Self Protocol integration perspective, the project scores 0/10 as there are no Self Protocol features implemented. The identity system relies on Farcaster FIDs and wallet addresses, lacking any privacy-preserving or verifiable credential aspects that Self Protocol offers. A critical security vulnerability related to Farcaster private key exposure needs immediate attention. While the general architecture is clean, the absence of a test suite and advanced error handling limits its production readiness. For this project to integrate Self Protocol, a significant architectural and development effort would be required to design and implement the necessary identity verification flows.
