## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Self SDK Integration Quality | 8.5/10 | Excellent use of `@selfxyz/core` and `@selfxyz/qrcode` for both frontend and backend, with dynamic configuration for minimum age. Could improve by actively using all stated features like country restrictions. |
| Contract Integration | 5.0/10 | The smart contract `EventChain.sol` stores Self-relevant data (`minimumAge`) but does not directly interact with or extend Self Protocol smart contracts for on-chain verification. Verification is off-chain. |
| Identity Verification Implementation | 8.0/10 | Comprehensive frontend QR code generation, dynamic endpoint configuration, correct `userId` usage, and backend proof verification flow. Successfully gates event registration based on age. |
| Proof Functionality | 6.5/10 | Strong implementation of dynamic age verification. While `AllIds` is used and `nationality`/`gender` are requested, the stated "Country restriction compliance" and "OFAC blacklist screening" are not actively implemented in the current verification logic. |
| Code Quality & Architecture | 7.0/10 | Good separation of concerns for Self features (frontend component, backend API). Logical flow for verification. However, lacks dedicated tests for Self integration and comprehensive in-code documentation beyond the README. |
| **Overall Technical Score** | 7.2/10 | The project effectively integrates Self Protocol for its primary use case (age verification) with a sound off-chain architecture. It demonstrates good SDK usage and a functional verification flow, but has room to grow by leveraging more advanced Self features and improving general development practices like testing. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal related to Self Protocol**: The primary goal is to enable age and identity verification for event ticketing on a decentralized platform. Specifically, it aims to filter ticket purchases based on age, country restrictions, and OFAC compliance using Self Protocol.
- **Problem solved for identity verification users/developers**: For users, it provides a privacy-preserving way to verify age or identity without sharing excessive personal data, enabling access to age-restricted events. For developers, it offers a clear example of integrating Self Protocol's SDKs for off-chain identity verification in a dApp.
- **Target users/beneficiaries within privacy-preserving identity space**: Event organizers who need to enforce age or geographic restrictions, and event attendees who want to prove their identity attributes (like age) without extensive data disclosure.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (73.0%), Solidity (15.92%), JavaScript (10.85%).
- **Self-specific libraries and frameworks used**:
    - `@selfxyz/common`
    - `@selfxyz/core`
    - `@selfxyz/qrcode`
- **Smart contract standards and patterns used**:
    - ERC-20 (for payment tokens)
    - OpenZeppelin contracts (`ReentrancyGuard`, `IERC20`, `Ownable`, `SafeERC20`)
    - ERC-677 (for G$ `transferAndCall` functionality)
- **Frontend/backend technologies supporting Self integration**:
    - **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Wagmi, RainbowKit, Tailwind CSS.
    - **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (for Self verification callback), Node.js.
    - **Blockchain**: Celo blockchain (mainnet and Alfajores testnet references).

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure**: The project is structured into `backend/` (Solidity smart contracts, Hardhat configuration) and `event-frontend/` (Next.js application).
- **Key components and their Self interactions**:
    - **`EventChain.sol` (Smart Contract)**: Stores `minimumAge` for each event, which is a parameter for Self verification.
    - **`EventForm.tsx` (Frontend)**: Allows event creators to set `minimumAge` for events, which is then stored on-chain.
    - **`EventPage.tsx` (Frontend)**: Displays the Self Protocol QR code for age verification. It dynamically configures the `SelfAppBuilder` with the event's `minimumAge` and the user's connected wallet address. It uses `SelfQRcodeWrapper` to render the QR and handles `onSuccess` callback to enable ticket purchase.
    - **`src/app/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx` (Backend API Route)**: This is the Self Protocol callback endpoint. It receives the zero-knowledge proof from the Self app, initializes `SelfBackendVerifier` with the event's dynamic `minimumAge` (passed via URL query), and verifies the proof.
- **Smart contract architecture (Self-related contracts)**: The `EventChain.sol` contract itself does not implement any Self Protocol-specific interfaces or logic for on-chain verification. It merely stores the `minimumAge` requirement, which is then enforced off-chain by the frontend/backend using Self Protocol.
- **Self integration approach (SDK vs direct contracts)**: The integration is primarily off-chain using the Self Protocol SDKs (frontend for QR generation, backend for proof verification). There is no direct smart contract integration with Self Protocol's on-chain verification roots.

## Security Analysis
- **Self-specific security patterns**:
    - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: The core of Self Protocol's privacy and security, handled by the SDK.
    - **`userIdType: "hex"`**: Using Ethereum addresses as user identifiers is a standard and secure practice for linking on-chain identities to off-chain proofs.
    - **Endpoint Security**: The backend verification endpoint is a POST request, and it expects specific proof data (`attestationId`, `proof`, `publicSignals`, `userContextData`).
- **Input validation for verification parameters**:
    - `minimumAge` is extracted from URL params and cast to `Number`, with a fallback to `0`. This is basic input handling.
    - In the backend `verify` routes, it checks for the presence of `proof`, `publicSignals`, `attestationId`, and `userContextData`.
- **Privacy protection mechanisms**:
    - Self Protocol inherently provides privacy through selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs, meaning users only reveal the necessary attribute (e.g., age >= X) without exposing their exact date of birth.
    - The use of `userId: ${address}` links the verification to a blockchain address, which is pseudonymous.
- **Identity data validation**: Handled by the `SelfBackendVerifier` SDK, which validates the cryptographic proofs.
- **Transaction security for Self operations**: Self operations themselves (proof generation, verification) do not involve direct blockchain transactions by the user. The outcome of the verification gates a subsequent blockchain transaction (e.g., `buyTicket`). The `buyTicket` function in `EventChain.sol` uses `nonReentrant` and `SafeERC20` for transaction security.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Self core functionalities implemented**:
    - Frontend QR code generation for identity requests.
    - Backend verification of zero-knowledge proofs.
    - Dynamic configuration of `minimumAge` disclosure based on event parameters.
    - Conditional access (ticket purchase) based on successful identity verification.
- **Verification execution correctness**: The flow as implemented seems correct: user scans QR, app generates proof, backend verifies, frontend updates. The `SelfBackendVerifier` handles the complex cryptographic validation.
- **Error handling for Self operations**: Basic `try-catch` blocks are present in the backend API routes and `onError` callback in the frontend `SelfQRcodeWrapper` to catch and report errors during verification.
- **Edge case handling for identity verification**:
    - No specific handling for "user cancels verification" or "proof expires" is explicitly shown in the provided snippets, beyond generic `onError`.
    - `minimumAge: 0` correctly bypasses age restriction.
- **Testing strategy for Self features**: No dedicated tests for Self Protocol integration are present in the provided `backend/test/EventChain.test.js` or elsewhere. This is a significant weakness.

## Code Quality & Architecture
- **Code organization for Self features**: Self-related logic is logically separated: frontend component (`EventPage.tsx`) for UI, and Next.js API routes (`/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`, `/api/verify/route.tsx`) for backend verification. This promotes modularity.
- **Documentation quality for Self integration**: The main `README.md` provides a good high-level overview of Self Protocol integration. However, in-code comments specifically for Self-related logic are minimal.
- **Naming conventions for Self-related components**: Follows standard conventions (e.g., `SelfQRcodeWrapper`, `SelfAppBuilder`, `SelfBackendVerifier`).
- **Complexity management in verification logic**: The complexity of ZKP verification is abstracted away by the `@selfxyz/core` SDK, keeping the application-level logic relatively simple and readable.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Self SDK and library management**: `package.json` correctly lists `@selfxyz/common`, `@selfxyz/core`, and `@selfxyz/qrcode` as dependencies with specific (beta) versions.
- **Installation process for Self dependencies**: Standard `pnpm install` (or `npm`/`yarn`).
- **Configuration approach for Self networks**: Uses environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENABLE_MOCK_PASSPORT`). `endpointType: "staging_https"` is explicitly set in `SelfAppBuilder`.
- **Deployment considerations for Self integration**: The use of `NGROK_URL` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT` suggests local development. For production, a stable, publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint would be required.

## Self Protocol Integration Analysis

### 1. **Self SDK Usage**
- **File Path**:
    - `event-frontend/package.json`
    - `event-frontend/src/app/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`
    - `event-frontend/src/app/api/verify/route.tsx`
    - `event-frontend/src/components/EventPage.tsx`
- **Implementation Quality**: Advanced
- **Code Snippet**:
    - `package.json`:
        ```json
        "@selfxyz/common": "^0.0.5",
        "@selfxyz/core": "^1.0.5-beta.1",
        "@selfxyz/qrcode": "^1.0.10-beta.1",
        ```
    - `event-frontend/src/components/EventPage.tsx`:
        ```typescript
        import { SelfQRcodeWrapper, SelfAppBuilder, type SelfApp } from "@selfxyz/qrcode";
        import { countries, getUniversalLink } from "@selfxyz/core";
        // ...
        const app = new SelfAppBuilder({
            version: 2,
            appName: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME || "Self Workshop",
            scope: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE || "self-workshop",
            endpoint, // dynamically constructed
            logoBase64: "https://i.postimg.cc/mrmVf9hm/self.png",
            userId: `${address}`,
            endpointType: "staging_https",
            userIdType: "hex",
            userDefinedData: "Bonjour Cannes!",
            disclosures: { minimumAge: Number(minimumAge), nationality: true, gender: true },
        }).build();
        setSelfApp(app);
        setUniversalLink(getUniversalLink(app));
        // ...
        <SelfQRcodeWrapper selfApp={selfApp} onSuccess={handleSuccessfulVerification} onError={() => { displayToast("Error: Failed to verify identity"); }} />
        ```
    - `event-frontend/src/app/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`:
        ```typescript
        import { SelfBackendVerifier, AttestationId, IConfigStorage, AllIds, DefaultConfigStore, VerificationConfig, countryCodes } from "@selfxyz/core";
        // ...
        const selfBackendVerifier = new SelfBackendVerifier(
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE as string,
            `${NGROK_URL}/api/events/${eventId}/verify`,
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENABLE_MOCK_PASSPORT === "true",
            AllIds,
            configStore,
            "hex"
        );
        const result = await selfBackendVerifier.verify(attestationId, proof, publicSignals, userContextData);
        ```
- **Security Assessment**: SDKs are correctly imported and initialized. Dynamic endpoint and `userId` are good. Using environment variables for sensitive configs (like scope) is good practice. `endpointType: "staging_https"` is appropriate for development/testing. No obvious vulnerabilities in SDK usage itself.

### 2. **Contract Integration**
- **File Path**: `backend/contracts/EventChain.sol`
- **Implementation Quality**: Basic
- **Code Snippet**:
    ```solidity
    struct Event {
        // ... other fields
        uint256 minimumAge; // Stored on-chain
        // ...
    }
    function createEvent(
        // ...
        uint256 _minimumAge,
        // ...
    ) public whenNotPaused {
        // ...
        minimumAge: _minimumAge,
        // ...
    }
    ```
- **Security Assessment**: The contract itself does not perform any direct Self Protocol-related operations or verification. It merely stores a `minimumAge` parameter. This means the security of the age restriction relies entirely on the off-chain (frontend/backend) Self Protocol integration. If the frontend/backend were bypassed, a user could potentially register for an age-restricted event without verification. This is a common pattern for off-chain identity, but it's important to acknowledge the trust boundaries.

### 3. **Identity Verification Implementation**
- **File Path**:
    - `event-frontend/src/components/EventPage.tsx`
    - `event-frontend/src/app/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`
    - `event-frontend/src/components/EventForm.tsx` (for setting `minimumAge`)
- **Implementation Quality**: Intermediate
- **Code Snippet**: (See SDK Usage snippets for `SelfAppBuilder` and `SelfQRcodeWrapper` in `EventPage.tsx`, and `SelfBackendVerifier` in `verify/route.tsx`)
    - `EventForm.tsx`:
        ```typescript
        // ...
        const minimumAge = BigInt(eventData.minimumAge);
        // ... passed to createEvent smart contract function
        ```
- **Security Assessment**: The flow correctly links the event's on-chain `minimumAge` to the Self verification request. The use of `onSuccess` to gate the "Complete Registration" button is a good security measure. Requesting `nationality` and `gender` in disclosures, while not actively used for gating, is a design choice that might be for future features or data collection.

### 4. **Proof & Verification Functionality**
- **File Path**:
    - `event-frontend/src/app/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`
    - `event-frontend/src/components/EventPage.tsx`
- **Implementation Quality**: Intermediate
- **Code Snippet**:
    - `event-frontend/src/app/api/events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`:
        ```typescript
        const disclosures_config: VerificationConfig = {
            excludedCountries: [], // Not actively used
            ofac: false,          // Not actively used
            minimumAge,           // Dynamically used
        };
        const configStore = new DefaultConfigStore(disclosures_config);
        // ...
        AllIds, // Accepts all document types
        ```
    - `event-frontend/src/components/EventPage.tsx`:
        ```typescript
        disclosures: {
            minimumAge: Number(minimumAge),
            // ofac: false, // Commented out/not used
            // excludedCountries: [countries.BELGIUM], // Commented out/not used
            nationality: true, // Requested, but not used for gating
            gender: true,      // Requested, but not used for gating
        },
        ```
- **Security Assessment**: The `minimumAge` proof is correctly enforced. The `AllIds` parameter allows for flexibility in document types. However, the lack of active implementation for `excludedCountries` and `ofac` (despite being mentioned in the README) means these security/compliance features are not currently operational. This is a gap between stated capabilities and actual implementation.

### 5. **Advanced Self Features**
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Implemented for `minimumAge` based on event creation.
- **Multi-Document Support**: `AllIds` is used in the backend verifier.
- **Privacy Implementation**: Selective disclosure for `minimumAge`, `nationality`, `gender`. `userIdType: "hex"` is used.
- **Compliance Integration**: `ofac` and `excludedCountries` are present in `VerificationConfig` structure but not dynamically configured or enforced in the current code. This feature is present in the SDK but not utilized.
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Not identified in the provided code.

### 6. **Implementation Quality Assessment**
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with frontend UI, backend API for verification, and smart contract for state. This is a suitable architecture for off-chain identity.
- **Error Handling**: Basic `try-catch` and `onError` callbacks are present. More granular error messages could be implemented for specific Self-related failures.
- **Privacy Protection**: Leverages Self Protocol's inherent privacy features.
- **Security**: The core logic for `minimumAge` gating is sound. However, the reliance on off-chain verification means the system is only as secure as its frontend and backend components. Lack of active country/OFAC checks (as stated in README) is a missed security opportunity.
- **Testing**: No dedicated tests for Self integration. The existing contract tests do not cover Self Protocol interactions. This is a major weakness.
- **Documentation**: High-level documentation in `README.md` is good, but in-code comments for Self-specific logic are sparse.

## Self Integration Summary

### Features Used:
- **Self SDK Methods**:
    - `@selfxyz/qrcode`: `SelfAppBuilder` (v2), `SelfQRcodeWrapper`, `getUniversalLink`.
    - `@selfxyz/core`: `SelfBackendVerifier` (v2), `DefaultConfigStore`, `VerificationConfig`, `AllIds`.
- **Configuration Details**:
    - `appName`: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME` (e.g., "EventChain").
    - `scope`: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE` (e.g., "self-workshop").
    - `endpoint`: Dynamic, pointing to `NGROK_URL/api/events/{eventId}/verify`.
    - `userId`: Ethereum address of the connected user.
    - `userIdType`: "hex".
    - `endpointType`: "staging_https".
    - `disclosures`: Primarily `minimumAge` (dynamically set per event), also `nationality: true`, `gender: true`.
    - `enableMockPassport`: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENABLE_MOCK_PASSPORT === "true"`.
- **Custom Implementations/Workarounds**: None specific to Self Protocol, primarily standard SDK usage.

### Implementation Quality:
- **Code Organization**: Self-related code is well-structured within the Next.js frontend and API routes, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns.
- **Architectural Decisions**: The choice of off-chain verification with on-chain parameter storage (`minimumAge` in `EventChain.sol`) is a practical and common approach for dApps.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place for SDK calls and API route failures.
- **Edge Case Management**: Limited explicit handling for edge cases like user-canceled verification or proof expiration beyond generic error messages.
- **Security Practices**: Leveraging Self Protocol's ZKP for privacy is strong. The use of environment variables and dynamic endpoints is good. However, the security of the age restriction is tied to the integrity of the off-chain components, as the smart contract does not re-verify on-chain.

### Best Practices Adherence:
- The project adheres well to Self SDK usage best practices, including proper initialization, dynamic configuration, and separation of frontend/backend concerns.
- It leverages the SDK for core ZKP functionalities, which is the recommended approach.
- **Deviations**: The `README` mentions "Country restriction compliance" and "OFAC blacklist screening," but the provided code does not actively configure or enforce these in the `VerificationConfig`, which is a deviation from the stated project goals.
- **Innovative/Exemplary Approaches**: The dynamic configuration of `minimumAge` directly from the smart contract's event parameters into the Self App Builder and Backend Verifier is a clean and effective way to integrate on-chain event requirements with off-chain identity verification.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **High Priority**:
    - **Implement Unit/Integration Tests for Self Features**: Crucial for ensuring correctness and preventing regressions. Tests should cover successful verification, failed verification (e.g., age too low), and error cases.
    - **Actively Implement Country/OFAC Restrictions**: The `README` states these features, but the code hardcodes them to `false`/empty. Fully implement dynamic configuration and enforcement if they are part of the project's vision. This would significantly enhance compliance and security.
    - **Robust Error Handling**: Provide more specific error messages for Self Protocol-related failures (e.g., "Age verification failed: User is too young," "Proof invalid").

- **Medium Priority**:
    - **Production-Ready Endpoint**: Replace `NGROK_URL` with a stable, secure, and publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint for the backend verification API in a production environment.
    - **Detailed Code Documentation**: Add more in-line comments and JSDoc for Self-specific functions and configurations to improve maintainability and onboarding for new developers.
    - **Frontend UI for Verification Status**: Provide clearer feedback to the user during the verification process (e.g., "Waiting for Self app approval," "Verifying proof...").
    - **Handle `nationality` and `gender` disclosures**: If these are requested, consider how their data might be used or displayed (e.g., for event analytics, if privacy-preserving).

- **Low Priority**:
    - **CI/CD Integration**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment, improving code quality and release reliability.
    - **Dependency Version Management**: Pin `@selfxyz` SDK versions to exact versions (`~` or `^` might pull in breaking changes for beta versions).

- **Self-Specific**:
    - **Explore On-Chain Verification (if applicable)**: If there's a need for the smart contract itself to *trustlessly* verify a Self proof, investigate `SelfVerificationRoot` contract integration. This would involve the contract calling a Self verification contract, but it adds significant complexity and gas costs. For the current use case (gating frontend access), the off-chain approach is suitable.
    - **Multi-Document Type Specific Logic**: While `AllIds` is used, consider if different event types might require specific document types (e.g., "Passport only" for international events).

## Technical Assessment from Senior Blockchain Developer Perspective
The project demonstrates a solid foundational understanding of integrating Self Protocol for off-chain identity verification, particularly for age-gating. The architectural separation between frontend (QR generation), backend (proof verification), and smart contract (parameter storage) is appropriate and well-executed for this use case. While the current implementation effectively solves the age verification problem, the project could significantly mature by fully leveraging Self Protocol's broader capabilities (e.g., country/OFAC restrictions as stated in the README) and adopting stronger software engineering practices such as comprehensive testing and CI/CD, which are currently lacking. This project is a good prototype or hackathon submission, showcasing functional integration, but requires further development to be production-ready and to fully realize its stated identity-related goals.

## Project Analysis Summary

| GitHub Repository | Self Implementation | Senior Developer Rating (1-10) |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| https://github.com/Chigozie0706/eventchain | Self Protocol SDKs are used for dynamic age verification (QR code generation on frontend, ZKP verification on backend) to gate event ticket purchases. | 7.2/10 |

### Key Self Features Implemented:
- **Self SDK Usage**: Advanced (correct use of `@selfxyz/qrcode` for frontend QR and `@selfxyz/core` for backend verification).
- **Identity Verification Implementation**: Intermediate (dynamic age-gating based on event parameters, user's Ethereum address as ID).
- **Proof Functionality**: Intermediate (effective age verification, but other stated features like country/OFAC checks are not actively implemented).

### Technical Assessment:
The EventChain project successfully integrates Self Protocol for age verification in a decentralized ticketing system, employing a sound off-chain architecture. The SDK usage is competent, dynamically configuring verification based on on-chain event parameters. However, the project's production readiness is hampered by a lack of dedicated tests for Self integration and incomplete implementation of all stated identity features.
