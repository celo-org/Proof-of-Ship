## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal**: To create a Farcaster Mini App called "MovieMeter" that allows users to vote Yes/No on movies and TV shows directly from Farcaster clients like Warpcast.
- **Problem solved**: Provides a decentralized platform for movie/TV show voting and discovery within the Farcaster ecosystem, with potential for rewards and community engagement.
- **Target users/beneficiaries**: Farcaster users interested in movies/TV shows, Web3 enthusiasts, and potentially content creators/distributors looking for community feedback.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (88.05%), JavaScript (11.41%), CSS (0.54%).
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code**:
    - **Frontend/Fullstack**: React, Next.js (15.0.3), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI (for UI components), Embla Carousel.
    - **Blockchain/Web3**: Wagmi (for wallet interaction), Viem (Ethereum utilities), `@farcaster/frame-sdk`, `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk`, `@farcaster/auth-client`, `@farcaster/frame-wagmi-connector`, NextAuth (for Farcaster authentication).
    - **Backend/Database**: Node.js, Mongoose (ORM for MongoDB), MongoDB Atlas.
    - **Utilities**: `dotenv`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react` (icons), `zod` (schema validation).
    - **Development/Build**: `tsx`, `localtunnel`, `pino-pretty`, `crypto`, `inquirer`.
- **Inferred runtime environment(s)**:
    - **Server-side**: Node.js (for Next.js API routes and server components, MongoDB interactions).
    - **Client-side**: Browser (for React components, Wagmi wallet interactions, Farcaster mini-app SDK).
    - **Blockchain**: Celo (Alfajores testnet primarily, with mainnet support).

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed**: The project follows a Next.js App Router structure (`src/app/`).
    - `src/app/`: Contains pages (`page.tsx`) and API routes (`api/`).
    - `src/components/`: Reusable React components (UI, business logic components like `MovieCard`, `CommentsSection`).
    - `src/lib/`: Utility functions (MongoDB, Farcaster API, TMDb API, general utilities).
    - `src/constants/`: Blockchain contract addresses and ABIs.
    - `src/data/`: Static JSON data (trailers).
    - `scripts/`: Build and deployment scripts.
- **Key modules/components and their roles**:
    - **Next.js API Routes (`src/app/api/`)**: Handle data fetching, voting, content management, Farcaster webhooks, and blockchain interactions. Examples: `/api/movies`, `/api/comments`, `/api/import/tmdb`, `/api/sync-contract`, `/api/webhook`.
    - **Frontend Pages (`src/app/`)**: Display content (movies, TV shows), leaderboards, rewards, watchlist, and admin interface. Examples: `/`, `/movies`, `/tv-shows`, `/leaderboards`, `/admin`.
    - **MongoDB Integration (`src/lib/mongo.ts`)**: Manages database connection, defines schemas (Movie, Vote, Notification, Watchlist, Comment), and provides CRUD operations.
    - **Farcaster Integration (`src/lib/farcaster.ts`, `src/components/FarcasterReady.tsx`, `src/components/providers/FrameProvider.tsx`)**: Handles Farcaster API interactions, authentication, and mini-app SDK readiness.
    - **Smart Contract Interaction (`src/constants/voteContract.ts`, Wagmi hooks)**: Defines the Celo smart contract for voting and facilitates on-chain transactions.
    - **TMDb Integration (`src/lib/tmdb.ts`)**: Fetches movie/TV show data from The Movie Database API.
    - **NextAuth (`src/auth.ts`, `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)**: Manages user authentication, specifically Farcaster sign-in.
- **Code organization assessment**:
    - **Good**: Clear separation of concerns between frontend components, backend API routes, and utility functions. Use of TypeScript and Mongoose schemas enhances data structure clarity. UI components are well-organized using Shadcn UI. Build/deploy scripts are separated.
    - **Areas for improvement**: Some API routes handle multiple actions via a `POST` body `action` field, which can make them less RESTful. The `src/app/discover/page.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx` seem to overlap in purpose, which could lead to confusion or redundancy. The `src/lib` directory is a bit of a catch-all; some utilities could be further grouped.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms**:
    - **Authentication**: Uses NextAuth with a Farcaster CredentialsProvider for user sign-in. This leverages `@farcaster/auth-client` for verifying Farcaster sign-in messages. Wagmi is used for wallet connection.
    - **Authorization**: There is no explicit authorization layer visible for critical actions like adding/resetting movies (e.g., `src/app/admin/page.tsx` or `/api/movies` `action: "add"`). The admin page is client-side rendered and relies on client-side navigation, making it accessible to anyone who knows the URL.
- **Data validation and sanitization**:
    - `zod` is used for `notificationDetailsSchema` in `src/app/api/send-notification/route.ts`.
    - `src/app/api/comments/route.ts` includes length checks for comment and reply content (1000 and 500 characters respectively).
    - General input validation for required fields in API routes (e.g., `movieId`, `address`).
    - However, there's no widespread, explicit input sanitization against XSS or SQL injection (though Mongoose typically handles basic NoSQL injection for document data).
- **Potential vulnerabilities**:
    1.  **Critical Farcaster Private Key Exposure**: `FARCASTER_SETUP.md` explicitly warns: "⚠️ **Important**: Since this runs in the browser, your private key will be visible to users." The `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable is used in `src/lib/farcaster.ts` for `generateAuthToken()`, which is called from client-side components (e.g., `Header.tsx` to fetch user profile). This is a severe security flaw, as anyone can extract the private key and impersonate the app or the associated Farcaster account.
    2.  **Cleartext MongoDB Credentials in `mcp.server.json`**: The `mcp.server.json` file contains a direct MongoDB connection string with `username:password@cluster.mongodb.net`. While this file might be for local development or specific tooling, exposing credentials in a non-environment variable file that could be committed is a risk.
    3.  **Lack of Authorization for Admin Actions**: The `/admin` page and associated API endpoints (`/api/movies` with `action: "add"`, `action: "reset"`, `/api/import/tmdb`, `/api/fix-poster-urls`) do not appear to have any server-side authorization checks. Any user could potentially add, modify, or delete content, or trigger imports.
    4.  **Missing CSRF Protection**: While NextAuth handles CSRF for its own routes, custom API routes (e.g., `/api/movies` for voting, `/api/comments`, `/api/watchlist`) might be vulnerable to CSRF attacks if not explicitly protected.
    5.  **No Rate Limiting**: There's no apparent rate limiting on API endpoints, which could make them vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks or excessive resource consumption.
    6.  **ESLint Ignored During Builds**: `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` in `next.config.js` is a red flag, indicating that potential code quality or security issues flagged by ESLint might be overlooked in production builds.
    7.  **Client-side `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`**: `APP_URL` in `src/lib/constants.ts` is `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL!`. While `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is for client-side access, it means this URL is client-readable and could be tampered with if not used carefully in server-side contexts where origin validation is critical.
- **Secret management approach**: Environment variables (`.env`, `.env.local`) are used for `MONGODB_URI`, `TMDB_API_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and Farcaster API keys. However, the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` issue is a critical flaw in how these secrets are handled, as it makes a private key publicly accessible. The `mcp.server.json` also directly embeds a MongoDB connection string.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented**:
    - **Movie/TV Show Listing**: Displays trending and recently added movies/TV shows on the homepage and dedicated `/movies`, `/tv-shows` pages.
    - **Voting**: Users can vote "Yes" or "No" on movies/TV shows. This interaction is designed to be on-chain (Celo network) via a smart contract and also recorded in MongoDB.
    - **Admin Interface (`/admin`)**: Allows manual addition of movies/TV shows, import from TMDb (trending/search), resetting content IDs, fixing poster URLs, and syncing content to the smart contract.
    - **Leaderboards (`/leaderboards`)**: Shows top voters, longest streaks, and top engagement based on MongoDB data.
    - **Watchlist (`/watchlist`)**: Users can add/remove movies to a personal watchlist (MongoDB).
    - **Comments Section**: Users can add comments and replies to movies, and like comments (MongoDB).
    - **Farcaster Mini App Integration**: Includes Farcaster authentication, profile fetching, and notification sending capabilities. Generates Farcaster metadata (`.well-known/farcaster.json`).
    - **TMDb Integration**: Fetches movie/TV show data from TMDb for display and import.
    - **Open Graph Image Generation**: Dynamically generates OG images for sharing.
- **Error handling approach**:
    - API routes use `try-catch` blocks and return `NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: ... }, { status: ... })` for errors.
    - Frontend components display loading states (`isLoading`, `isPending`), error messages (`setError`), and alerts for transaction failures (e.g., "Insufficient CELO for gas fees", "Transaction was cancelled").
    - Specific error messages are provided for blockchain interactions (e.g., "Smart contract execution failed" with possible reasons).
- **Edge case handling**:
    - Loading indicators are present for data fetches and blockchain transactions.
    - Empty states are handled for movie lists, leaderboards, comments, and watchlists.
    - "Movie Not Found" page for invalid movie IDs.
    - Image fallbacks for missing poster URLs (displaying "No Poster").
    - Network switching logic for Celo is implemented in Wagmi providers and movie pages.
- **Testing strategy**:
    - **Weakness**: GitHub metrics explicitly state "Missing tests" and "No CI/CD configuration".
    - The codebase contains `src/lib/test-connection.ts`, `src/lib/test-tmdb-images.ts`, and corresponding API routes (`/api/test-db`, `/api/test-tmdb`, `/api/test-contract`, `/api/debug-movies`, `/api/test-images`, `/api/test-real-tmdb`) which are manual testing/debugging routes. These are useful for development but do not constitute a comprehensive automated testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end tests).
    - `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` suggests that even static code analysis issues are not strictly enforced.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency**: Generally consistent, following a modern React/Next.js TypeScript style. Shadcn UI components provide a consistent UI/UX. Tailwind CSS is used effectively for styling.
- **Documentation quality**:
    - `README.md` is comprehensive, detailing features, tech stack, local development, environment variables, and database setup. This is a significant strength.
    - `FARCASTER_SETUP.md` provides crucial instructions for Farcaster API setup, including security warnings.
    - In-code comments are present in some complex logic (e.g., Farcaster API client, MongoDB connection, deployment scripts) but could be more extensive in business logic components and API routes.
    - No dedicated documentation directory, as noted in weaknesses.
- **Naming conventions**: Clear and descriptive naming conventions are used for variables, functions, components, and files (e.g., `MovieCard`, `handleVote`, `fetchMovies`, `MovieModel`).
- **Complexity management**:
    - The project effectively breaks down functionality into smaller, manageable components (React components, API routes, utility modules).
    - Mongoose schemas clearly define data models.
    - `scripts/` directory separates build/deploy logic from the main application.
    - The use of `use(params)` for data fetching in `movies/[id]/page.tsx` is a modern Next.js pattern that can simplify data flow.
    - The `FrameProvider` and `WagmiProvider` correctly encapsulate Web3-related logic.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach**: `npm` is used for package management, with `package.json` clearly listing `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.
- **Installation process**: Detailed instructions are provided in `README.md` for `git clone`, `npm install`, and `npm run dev`. Environment variable setup is also clearly outlined. The `scripts/dev.js` includes helpful port checking and cleanup.
- **Configuration approach**: Environment variables are managed via `.env` and `.env.local` files. The `scripts/build.js` and `scripts/deploy.js` interact with these files and `inquirer` to guide the user through configuration, including generating Farcaster metadata and NextAuth secrets. Vercel-specific configuration is handled in `vercel.json`.
- **Deployment considerations**: The `scripts/deploy.js` provides a robust, interactive script for deploying to Vercel, including Vercel CLI installation, login, project setup, environment variable configuration, and actual deployment. This is a strong point for ease of deployment. `vercel.json` defines build commands and redirects for Farcaster manifest.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration**
    -   **Next.js**: Excellent use of App Router, API routes, server components (`share/[fid]/page.tsx`), client components (`"use client"`), and `next/image` for image optimization. The dynamic import of `WagmiConfig` (`src/app/providers.tsx`) demonstrates an understanding of SSR limitations for Web3 libraries.
    -   **React**: Standard functional components, `useState`, `useEffect` for state and lifecycle management.
    -   **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI**: Well-integrated for a modern, responsive UI. `components.json` and `tailwind.config.ts` show proper setup.
    -   **Mongoose**: Correctly used for MongoDB ORM, defining schemas, connection management, and CRUD operations.
    -   **Wagmi & Viem**: Properly configured for Celo blockchain interaction (wallet connection, `useAccount`, `useChainId`, `useSwitchChain`, `useWriteContract`, `useBalance`). The logic for auto-switching to Celo and displaying gas fee warnings is a good practice for blockchain applications.
    -   **Farcaster SDKs**: Integration with `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` (e.g., `sdk.actions.ready()`) and `@farcaster/frame-sdk` (for notifications) is present. The custom Farcaster API client in `src/lib/farcaster.ts` and NextAuth CredentialsProvider for Farcaster sign-in are notable.
    -   **Overall**: The project demonstrates a strong command of the chosen technologies, integrating them cohesively.
2.  **API Design and Implementation**
    -   **RESTful-like API routes**: Uses Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/movies`, `/api/comments`, `/api/watchlist`).
    -   **Proper endpoint organization**: Endpoints are logically grouped (e.g., `movies`, `tv-shows`, `leaderboards`).
    -   **Request/response handling**: Uses `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` for clear request/response handling. JSON is consistently used for data transfer.
    -   **API versioning**: Not explicitly versioned, but for a smaller project, this is often acceptable.
    -   **Action-based POSTs**: Some POST endpoints (e.g., `/api/movies`) use an `action` field in the request body to differentiate operations, which is a common pattern in non-pure REST APIs.
3.  **Database Interactions**
    -   **Data model design**: Mongoose schemas are well-defined for `Movie`, `Vote`, `Notification`, `Watchlist`, and `Comment` with appropriate fields and types.
    -   **ORM/ODM usage**: Mongoose is effectively used for object-document mapping, abstracting direct MongoDB commands.
    -   **Connection management**: `src/lib/mongo.ts` includes robust connection logic (`connectMongo`, `disconnectMongo`, `ensureConnection`) with connection pooling (`maxPoolSize`) and error handling.
    -   **Query optimization**: Indexes are defined for `voteSchema` and `watchlistSchema` (`unique: true`, `index: true`) which is good for performance and data integrity. Comments also have an index.
4.  **Frontend Implementation**
    -   **UI component structure**: Modular components (e.g., `MovieCard`, `Header`, `BottomNav`, `CommentsSection`, `WatchlistButton`) are used to build the UI. Shadcn UI components are integrated for a polished look.
    -   **State management**: `useState` and `useEffect` are used for local component state and side effects. `useSession` from NextAuth manages user session. Wagmi hooks manage Web3 state.
    -   **Responsive design**: Tailwind CSS and component design indicate responsiveness, though explicit media queries are minimal, relying on Tailwind's mobile-first approach.
    -   **Accessibility considerations**: Basic accessibility is present (e.g., `sr-only` for carousel buttons, `aria-label`).
5.  **Performance Optimization**
    -   **Edge runtime**: Some API routes (`opengraph-image`, `debug-movies`, `fix-poster-urls`, `import/tmdb`, `movie`, `movies`, `sync-contract`, `test-contract`, `test-db`, `test-tmdb`, `tv-shows`, `vote`) are configured with `export const runtime = 'edge'` or `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`. The `edge` runtime for `opengraph-image` is a good choice for fast image generation.
    -   **Caching strategies**: `cache: "force-cache"` for TMDb configuration, `cache: "no-store"` for dynamic TMDb fetches. `revalidate = 300` for `share/[fid]/page.tsx` metadata.
    -   **Resource loading optimization**: `next/image` component is used for image optimization. Dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) are used for Wagmi components to prevent SSR issues.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Critical Security Fixes**:
    *   **Remove Farcaster Private Key from Browser**: Refactor `src/lib/farcaster.ts` and any client-side calls to `generateAuthToken()` to ensure the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` is *never* exposed to the browser. All Farcaster API calls requiring authentication must be proxied through a secure server-side endpoint where the private key is stored as a server-only environment variable.
    *   **Secure Admin Endpoints**: Implement robust server-side authentication and authorization for all admin-related API routes (`/api/movies` with `action: "add"`, `action: "reset"`, `/api/import/tmdb`, `/api/fix-poster-urls`). This could involve checking for an authenticated admin user or an API key.
    *   **MongoDB Credentials**: Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is *only* used via environment variables and never hardcoded or stored in files that could be committed to version control. Remove the cleartext credential from `mcp.server.json`.
2.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Develop a full suite of automated tests: unit tests for utility functions, integration tests for API routes and database interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
    *   Integrate a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests and deploy on successful builds.
    *   Remove `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` from `next.config.js` and address any ESLint warnings.
3.  **Refine API Design**:
    *   Consider making API routes more RESTful by creating separate endpoints for distinct actions (e.g., `/api/movies/add`, `/api/movies/vote`, `/api/movies/reset`) instead of using an `action` field in a single POST endpoint. This improves clarity and maintainability.
    *   Implement server-side input validation and sanitization more broadly across all API routes to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
4.  **Enhance User Experience and Features**:
    *   **Farcaster Notifications**: Fully implement the native Farcaster notification sending logic in `src/lib/farcaster.ts` (currently a placeholder).
    *   **Redundancy**: Clarify the purpose or consolidate `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/discover/page.tsx` if their functionalities largely overlap.
    *   **Content Management**: Add a UI for editing and deleting existing movies/TV shows in the admin panel.
    *   **Error Reporting**: Implement a more user-friendly global error reporting mechanism (e.g., toast notifications) instead of `alert()` for better UX.
5.  **Code Quality and Maintainability**:
    *   **In-code Documentation**: Add more detailed JSDoc comments for functions, interfaces, and complex logic, especially in utility files and API routes, to improve long-term maintainability.
    *   **Consistency in Voting Logic**: Review `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/movies/page.tsx`, `src/app/movies/[id]/page.tsx`, and `src/app/vote-movies/page.tsx` to ensure consistent and correct integration of the Wagmi `useWriteContract` hook, especially regarding `isPending` and `error` states, and the `votes` state management.
    *   **Containerization**: Add Dockerfile and Docker Compose for easier local development and deployment in containerized environments.
