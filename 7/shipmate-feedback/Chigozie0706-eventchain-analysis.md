## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 3.0/10 | Critical vulnerabilities due to client-side exposure of Pinata JWT and hardcoded `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` for production, reliance on `ngrok` for Self.ID, and a hardcoded UBI pool address. Reentrancy guard is a positive. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 6.0/10 | Core features are implemented and backend tests exist. However, significant inconsistencies in contract addresses across frontend files and READMEs, duplicated Solidity functions, and a likely broken Next.js API route reduce the score. |
| Readability & Understandability | 7.5/10 | Comprehensive `README.md` files and a clear project structure are strong points. Code is generally well-named. However, the ignored ESLint errors in frontend and duplicated Solidity functions introduce inconsistencies. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 8.0/10 | Uses standard, modern tools (Hardhat, Next.js, Wagmi, RainbowKit, pnpm). Setup instructions are clear and environment variable usage is documented, though with critical security flaws for some variables. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 5.0/10 | Demonstrates ambition with multiple advanced integrations (Divvi, GoodDollar, Self.ID, MiniPay, IPFS). However, the implementation of IPFS (Pinata JWT exposure) and Self.ID (`ngrok` endpoint) is severely flawed in terms of best practices and security. |
| **Overall Score** | 5.4/10 | Weighted average: (Security * 0.25) + (Functionality * 0.20) + (Readability * 0.15) + (Dependencies * 0.10) + (Technical Usage * 0.30) = (3.0*0.25) + (6.0*0.20) + (7.5*0.15) + (8.0*0.10) + (5.0*0.30) = 0.75 + 1.2 + 1.125 + 0.8 + 1.5 = 5.375 |

## Project Summary
-   **Primary purpose/goal**: To provide a decentralized event ticketing platform on the Celo blockchain.
-   **Problem solved**: Offers a transparent, secure, and verifiable way to create events, sell tickets, and manage refunds without a central authority, while also integrating social good features like Universal Basic Income (UBI) donations and referral incentives.
-   **Target users/beneficiaries**: Event organizers looking for a decentralized platform, attendees seeking secure ticket purchases, and potentially users interested in supporting on-chain UBI or earning referral incentives.

## Technology Stack
-   **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (frontend), Solidity (smart contracts), JavaScript (deployment scripts, some frontend utility).
-   **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code**:
    *   **Blockchain**: Hardhat (development, testing, deployment of contracts), OpenZeppelin Contracts (Solidity security & utilities), Wagmi, RainbowKit, Viem (Web3 interactions).
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework), Tailwind CSS (styling), Axios (HTTP requests).
    *   **Integrations**: `@divvi/referral-sdk`, `@goodsdks/citizen-sdk` (GoodDollar), `@selfxyz/core` & `@selfxyz/qrcode` (Self Protocol for identity), `@pinata/sdk` (IPFS uploads).
-   **Inferred runtime environment(s)**: Node.js for both backend (Hardhat) and frontend (Next.js). Browser environment for the frontend dApp.

## Architecture and Structure
-   **Overall project structure observed**: The project is organized into two main directories: `backend/` for smart contracts and `event-frontend/` for the Next.js application. This separation of concerns is clear and appropriate for a dApp.
-   **Key modules/components and their roles**:
    *   `backend/contracts/EventChain.sol`: The core smart contract handling event creation, ticket sales, refunds, and fund management.
    *   `backend/test/EventChain.test.js`: Unit tests for the `EventChain` smart contract.
    *   `backend/ignition/modules/EventChain.js`: Hardhat Ignition deployment script.
    *   `event-frontend/src/app/`: Next.js App Router structure for different pages (home, create event, view events, my tickets, event details).
    *   `event-frontend/src/components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `EventCard`, `EventForm`, `Navbar`, `EventPage`).
    *   `event-frontend/src/providers/providers.tsx`: Configures Wagmi and RainbowKit for wallet connectivity.
    *   `event-frontend/src/app/api/`: Next.js API routes for specific backend interactions (e.g., `getAddress`, `verify`, `proxy-image`).
-   **Code organization assessment**: The top-level separation into `backend` and `event-frontend` is good. Within the frontend, the use of the Next.js App Router for page organization and a `components` directory for reusable UI elements is standard and logical. The `contract` directory holding `abi.json` is also appropriate. However, the `src/app/api/proxy-image/route,js` file, being a `.js` file in a TypeScript project and using `req.query` (Pages Router style) in an App Router context, indicates a potential organizational or correctness issue.

## Security Analysis
-   **Authentication & authorization mechanisms**:
    *   **Blockchain**: Wallet connection (RainbowKit/Wagmi) provides user authentication. Authorization on smart contracts is handled by `onlyOwner` modifier for `cancelEvent` and `releaseFunds` functions, ensuring only the event creator can perform these actions.
    *   **Frontend**: Relies on blockchain-based authentication. Self Protocol (Self.ID) is integrated for identity and age verification, which adds a layer of off-chain identity assurance.
-   **Data validation and sanitization**:
    *   **Smart Contract (`EventChain.sol`)**: Extensive input validation using `require` statements for event creation (name length, URL length, details length, location length, price range, date/time validity, supported token check, minimum age). This is a strong positive.
    *   **Frontend**: Basic form validation is present in `EventForm.tsx` before sending transactions.
-   **Potential vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Critical: Client-side Pinata JWT exposure**: The `EventForm.tsx` and `ImageUploader.tsx` components directly use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT` for API authorization. This exposes the Pinata JWT to anyone inspecting the frontend code, making it highly vulnerable to abuse and unauthorized API calls.
    *   **Critical: `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`**: While common for local Hardhat development, the `backend/hardhat.config.js` directly reads `process.env.PRIVATE_KEY` for deployment to `celo_mainnet`. If this `.env` file is used in a production environment, it's a severe security risk. Production deployments should use secure key management solutions.
    *   **High: `ngrok` for Self.ID endpoint**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT` is configured to use `ngrok` for the Self.ID backend verifier (`/api/events/[eventId]/verify`). `ngrok` tunnels are temporary and insecure for production use, making the identity verification process unreliable and potentially vulnerable.
    *   **Hardcoded `ubiPool` address**: The `ubiPool` address is hardcoded in `EventChain.sol`. While not a direct vulnerability, it reduces flexibility and makes it difficult to update the UBI pool address without redeploying the contract, which is not ideal for long-term maintenance.
    *   **Reentrancy**: The `ReentrancyGuard` OpenZeppelin contract is correctly imported and used in `buyTicket` and `requestRefund` functions, which is excellent.
    *   **Missing comprehensive tests**: The GitHub metrics indicate missing tests overall, which often implies a higher risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
-   **Secret management approach**:
    *   Environment variables (`.env` files) are used for `PRIVATE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENABLE_MOCK_PASSPORT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` (Mapbox), and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT`.
    *   As noted above, the client-side exposure of `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT` and the use of `PRIVATE_KEY` directly from `.env` for mainnet deployment are critical flaws in the secret management strategy. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` for Mapbox is less critical as it's a public API key, but still best practice to proxy it if possible.

## Functionality & Correctness
-   **Core functionalities implemented**:
    *   Event creation with various details (name, image, description, dates, times, location, price, minimum age, payment token).
    *   Ticket purchasing using multiple Celo stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL), G$ (with 1% UBI donation), USDT, and native CELO.
    *   Refund mechanism for canceled events or before a specified deadline.
    *   Event cancellation by the event owner.
    *   Funds release to event owner after event completion.
    *   Referral tracking via Divvi SDK.
    *   Identity/age verification using Self.ID.
    *   IPFS for image uploads.
    *   MiniPay integration for mobile payments.
    *   Viewing all events, user's purchased tickets, and user's created events.
-   **Error handling approach**:
    *   **Smart Contract**: Uses `require` statements for all critical validations (e.g., `require(event_.startDate > block.timestamp, "Event expired")`). Custom errors are not explicitly defined but revert messages are used.
    *   **Frontend**: Uses `react-hot-toast` for user feedback on transaction status (loading, success, error) and form validation errors. `try-catch` blocks are used for asynchronous operations and contract interactions.
-   **Edge case handling**:
    *   **Smart Contract**: Handles native CELO payments (`address(0)`), G$ `transferAndCall` with a fee, and standard ERC-20 transfers. Checks for event expiration, capacity, and double purchases. Refund logic includes checks for cancellation and refund period.
    *   **Frontend**: Handles loading states, error displays, and checks for existing tickets.
-   **Testing strategy**:
    *   **Backend (Smart Contracts)**: A `backend/test/EventChain.test.js` file exists, using Hardhat and Chai. It covers basic functionality like initialization, event creation (including invalid parameters), ticket purchasing (including insufficient allowance and capacity), refunds (before event, for canceled event, after refund period), and funds release. This indicates a foundational testing approach.
    *   **Frontend**: No explicit frontend tests (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) are visible in the digest, which aligns with the "Missing tests" weakness reported in GitHub metrics.
    *   **Inconsistencies**: The `EventChain.sol` contract contains two versions of `requestRefund` and `releaseFunds` (e.g., `requestRefund` and `requestRefund1`). The `requestRefund` and `releaseFunds` functions are more complete, handling native CELO, while the `_processRefund` function (called by `requestRefund1`) only handles ERC-20. This suggests incomplete refactoring or leftover code, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs if the wrong function is called.
    *   **Contract Address Inconsistency**: The `event-frontend/src/app/client.tsx` hardcodes a contract address for `celoAlfajoresTestnet` (`0xdad1dCA04Ec7d1B05155FA96b4A646B81653FBFA`), which differs from the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` used in other frontend components (`0xcbfbBF29fD197b2Cf79B236E86e6Bade5a552eD8`) and the `README.md` (which lists a Celo Mainnet address). This is a critical bug that needs to be resolved for the application to function correctly on a consistent network.
    *   **Broken API Route**: `event-frontend/src/app/api/proxy-image/route,js` is a `.js` file in a TypeScript project using `req.query` for parameter access, which is typical for Next.js Pages Router API routes. Given the project uses the App Router, this API route is likely misconfigured or broken.

## Readability & Understandability
-   **Code style consistency**: Generally consistent. Frontend uses TypeScript with Next.js conventions. Solidity follows common patterns and OpenZeppelin usage.
-   **Documentation quality**: Excellent `README.md` files for both the root and `backend` directories. They provide a clear project overview, features, technology stack, smart contract details, deployment steps, and user flow. This significantly aids understandability. Inline comments in Solidity are also helpful.
-   **Naming conventions**: Consistent and descriptive naming for variables, functions, and components in both Solidity and TypeScript. For example, `createEvent`, `buyTicket`, `EventChain.sol`, `EventCard.tsx`.
-   **Complexity management**: The project handles several complex integrations (blockchain interactions, multiple tokens, identity verification, referrals, IPFS). While the individual components are reasonably sized, the overall system complexity is high due to the number of external dependencies. The `EventPage.tsx` and `EventForm.tsx` components are quite large due to handling various interactions and form fields. The duplicated Solidity functions (`requestRefund`/`requestRefund1`, `releaseFunds`/`releaseFunds1`) add unnecessary complexity and reduce clarity. The frontend `next.config.ts` explicitly ignores ESLint errors during builds, which is a major red flag for maintaining code quality and understandability over time.

## Dependencies & Setup
-   **Dependencies management approach**: `package.json` files are used in both `backend` and `event-frontend` for dependency management. `pnpm` is specified for the frontend, while `npm` or `yarn` are mentioned as alternatives for the backend. `dotenv` is used for environment variables.
-   **Installation process**: Clearly documented in both `README.md` files, providing step-by-step instructions for cloning, installing dependencies, compiling, deploying contracts, and starting the frontend. Prerequisites are also listed.
-   **Configuration approach**: Relies on `.env` files for sensitive information and API keys, which is standard practice for local development. However, the security concerns regarding `PRIVATE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT` in production contexts are significant.
-   **Deployment considerations**: Instructions for deploying the smart contract using Hardhat Ignition to Celo Mainnet are provided. The frontend is mentioned as deployed on Vercel. The `next.config.ts` includes `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers for API routes, suggesting cross-origin considerations for deployment. The use of `ngrok` for the Self.ID endpoint is a development-only solution and needs to be replaced with a stable, secure public endpoint for production deployment.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration**:
    *   **Solidity/Hardhat**: Effective use of Hardhat for contract development, compilation, testing, and deployment. OpenZeppelin contracts (`ReentrancyGuard`, `IERC20`, `SafeERC20`) are correctly imported for security and standard token interactions. Hardhat Ignition is used for deployment, which is a modern approach.
    *   **Next.js/Wagmi/RainbowKit/Viem**: The frontend leverages Next.js App Router, Wagmi hooks (`useAccount`, `useReadContract`, `useWriteContract`, `useWaitForTransactionReceipt`, `useWalletClient`, `useBalance`), and RainbowKit for wallet connection. Viem is used for encoding function data and interacting with the wallet client. This is a robust and modern Web3 frontend stack.
    *   **Divvi SDK**: Integrated for referral tracking, demonstrating an understanding of how to append custom data to transactions.
    *   **GoodDollar UBI Pool Integration**: A 1% fee from G$ token purchases is automatically sent to the UBI pool, showcasing a social impact integration.
    *   **Self Protocol (Self.ID)**: Integration for age/identity verification, including a backend verifier API route and frontend QR code wrapper. This is a complex and advanced identity solution. However, the reliance on `ngrok` for the endpoint is a critical implementation flaw for production.
    *   **IPFS (Pinata)**: Used for image uploads. The concept is sound for decentralized storage, but the implementation exposes the Pinata JWT on the client-side, which is a severe security misstep.
    *   **MiniPay Integration**: Custom logic in `MiniPayScripts.tsx` and `Navbar.tsx` detects MiniPay and auto-connects, indicating a specific effort to support Celo's mobile-first wallet.
2.  **API Design and Implementation**:
    *   The project primarily uses Next.js API routes (`/api/*`). `getAddress` uses Mapbox, `verify` handles Self.ID verification. The `proxy-image` route is likely broken due to using Pages Router syntax in an App Router context. These are not a full-fledged REST API but rather specific serverless functions.
3.  **Database Interactions (Smart Contract Interactions)**:
    *   The `EventChain.sol` contract is well-structured for managing events and tickets. It correctly handles multiple ERC-20 tokens (including specific logic for G$ `transferAndCall` and native CELO).
    *   The frontend uses Wagmi's `useReadContract` and `useWriteContract` hooks for interacting with the smart contract, demonstrating correct and idiomatic Web3 interaction patterns.
    *   Parsing and formatting of token amounts (e.g., `ethers.formatUnits`, `parseUnits`) ensure correct handling of token decimals.
4.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   Uses React with Next.js App Router, state management with `useState` and Wagmi hooks.
    *   UI components (`EventCard`, `EventForm`, `EventPage`) are well-defined and reusable.
    *   Tailwind CSS is used for styling, indicating a modern approach to responsive design.
    *   Blockies are used for attendee avatars, enhancing UI/UX.
5.  **Performance Optimization**:
    *   Beyond standard Next.js optimizations (SSR/SSG capabilities, image optimization for `Image` component, though `img` tags are used), no explicit performance optimizations are evident in the provided digest (e.g., caching strategies, complex algorithms). Smart contract gas optimization is enabled in `hardhat.config.js`.

The project demonstrates an ambitious scope and integrates several advanced Web3 technologies. However, the quality of implementation varies, with critical security flaws in how some integrations (Pinata JWT, Self.ID endpoint) are handled, and functional inconsistencies (contract addresses, duplicate Solidity functions, broken API route).

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Address Critical Security Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Pinata JWT**: Refactor IPFS image uploads to occur on a secure backend (e.g., a Next.js API route) where the Pinata JWT can be stored as a server-side environment variable, never exposed to the client.
    *   **Private Key**: Implement a robust and secure secret management solution for the `PRIVATE_KEY` for mainnet deployments, such as a dedicated KMS (Key Management Service) or hardware wallet integration, instead of relying on `.env` files.
    *   **Self.ID Endpoint**: Replace `ngrok` with a stable, secure, and production-ready public endpoint (e.g., a dedicated server, Vercel serverless function) for the Self.ID backend verifier.
2.  **Improve Smart Contract Correctness and Maintainability**:
    *   **Refactor Duplicated Functions**: Consolidate `requestRefund` and `requestRefund1`, and `releaseFunds` and `releaseFunds1` into single, clear functions. Remove any redundant or incomplete code to improve readability and prevent potential bugs.
    *   **Configurable UBI Pool**: Make the `ubiPool` address a configurable parameter in the smart contract, allowing it to be updated by the contract owner via an `Ownable` function, rather than hardcoding it.
    *   **Comprehensive Testing**: Expand the smart contract test suite to achieve higher coverage, including unit tests for all functions, edge cases, and potential attack vectors (e.g., denial of service, integer overflow/underflow if not covered by SafeMath).
3.  **Enhance Frontend Robustness and Consistency**:
    *   **Resolve Contract Address Inconsistencies**: Ensure a single, consistent contract address is used across all frontend files and documentation for the target network (e.g., Celo Mainnet or Alfajores testnet). Dynamic loading of addresses based on network could be considered.
    *   **Fix Broken API Route**: Correctly implement the `proxy-image` API route using Next.js App Router conventions (e.g., `route.ts`) and ensure it functions as intended, potentially serving as a secure proxy for external image fetching.
    *   **Enable ESLint for Builds**: Re-enable ESLint during builds (`ignoreDuringBuilds: false`) and resolve all reported errors to enforce code quality, consistency, and catch potential bugs early.
4.  **Implement CI/CD and Containerization**:
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing, linting, and deployment of both the smart contracts and the frontend. This will ensure code quality, faster development cycles, and reliable deployments.
    *   **Containerization**: Consider containerizing the application (e.g., Docker) for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments, especially for the backend verifier component of Self.ID.

**Potential Future Development Directions**:
-   **NFT-based Ticketing**: As suggested in the `backend/README.md`, converting tickets into NFTs could unlock secondary markets and enhanced verifiable ownership.
-   **Dynamic Token Support**: Implement a mechanism to allow new tokens to be added dynamically by the event owner or a governance mechanism.
-   **Event Discovery & Search**: Enhance the frontend with more advanced event filtering, search capabilities, and possibly integration with mapping services for physical events.
-   **Decentralized Governance**: Introduce DAO-like features for community event curation or platform upgrades.
-   **Advanced Refund Policies**: Implement more flexible refund policies (e.g., partial refunds, tiered refunds, different refund tokens).
