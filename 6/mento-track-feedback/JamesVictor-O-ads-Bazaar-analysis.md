## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal related to Mento Protocol**: AdsBazaar aims to be the first global multi-currency influencer marketing platform. Its primary goal related to Mento Protocol is to enable seamless, low-cost cross-border transactions by allowing businesses to pay and influencers to earn in local stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cNGN, cKES, eXOF, cREAL) provided by Mento.
- **Problem solved for stable asset users/developers**:
    - For **stable asset users** (influencers and businesses): It eliminates the complexities, delays, and high fees associated with traditional foreign exchange and international bank transfers. Users can transact directly in their preferred local stablecoin, ensuring price stability and local purchasing power.
    - For **stable asset developers**: It provides a blueprint and working implementation for integrating Mento Protocol's stablecoins and exchange functionality directly into a dApp. This includes on-chain multi-currency escrow, flexible payment claims, real-time exchange rate display, and robust swap functionality, addressing common challenges in building multi-currency DeFi applications.
- **Target users/beneficiaries within DeFi/stable asset space**: The platform targets a broad range of global influencers and businesses, with a particular focus on emerging markets (e.g., Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, West Africa, Europe) where local currency accessibility is crucial. It also benefits developers looking to build on Celo and integrate Mento's stablecoin ecosystem for diverse, localized DeFi use cases.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (76.38%), Solidity (15.05%), JavaScript (8.54%).
- **Mento-specific libraries and frameworks used**:
    - **Frontend**: `@mento-protocol/mento-sdk` (for live exchange rates and swaps), `frontend/lib/mento-live.ts` (wrapper for Mento SDK calls), `frontend/lib/mento-simple.ts` (simplified interface for Mento token data and FX operations).
    - **Smart Contracts**: `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol` (custom Solidity library for Mento token management and utilities), `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet.sol` (for multi-currency payment logic), `MultiCurrencyCampaignFacet.sol` (for multi-currency campaign creation/management).
- **Smart contract standards and patterns used**: EIP-2535 Diamond Standard (for upgradeability and modularity), ERC20 (for stablecoin interactions), OpenZeppelin Contracts (for common utilities like `ReentrancyGuard`).
- **Frontend/backend technologies supporting Mento integration**:
    - **Frontend**: Next.js, React hooks (Wagmi for blockchain interaction), Ethers.js (used internally by Mento SDK for provider/signer abstraction), Viem (for low-level contract interactions and transaction sending).
    - **Backend**: Node.js (for Next.js API routes, potentially for off-chain services like Farcaster integration and Divvi tracking).

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure**: The project is structured as a Next.js frontend application that interacts with a modular Solidity smart contract deployed on the Celo blockchain. Backend API routes handle specific off-chain functionalities (e.g., Farcaster profile fetching, Self Protocol verification, campaign share tracking).
- **Key components and their Mento interactions**:
    - **Smart Contract (AdsBazaarDiamond)**: Acts as the central entry point. Mento-specific logic is implemented in `MultiCurrencyCampaignFacet` (for campaign creation, cancellation, expiration, and token info retrieval) and `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet` (for claiming payments, setting preferences, and getting payment summaries). These facets rely on `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar` for shared logic, such as token whitelisting, address-to-currency mapping, and utility functions.
    - **Frontend Hooks**: Custom React hooks such as `useMultiCurrencyCampaignCreation`, `useMultiCurrencyPayments`, `useMultiCurrencyPendingPayments`, `useMultiCurrencyBalances`, `useExchangeRates`, and `useCurrencySwap` abstract complex Mento interactions, providing a clean interface to UI components.
    - **UI Components**: `CurrencySelector`, `CurrencyConverter`, and `MentoFXDemo` are dedicated components that display Mento-powered exchange rates and facilitate currency selection and conversion. The `Header` and `WalletFundingModal` also integrate Mento stablecoin balances and funding options.
    - **`lib/mento-live.ts`**: This module is critical for fetching real-time exchange rates from the Mento Protocol's AMM using the `@mento-protocol/mento-sdk`, including caching and fallback mechanisms.
- **Smart contract architecture (Mento-related contracts)**: The project leverages the EIP-2535 Diamond Standard, which allows for modular and upgradeable contract logic. Mento-related functionalities are encapsulated in dedicated facets (`MultiCurrencyCampaignFacet`, `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet`) and a shared library (`LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol`). This design promotes maintainability and enables future expansions or updates to Mento integration without redeploying the entire system.
- **Mento integration approach (SDK vs direct contracts)**: The project employs a hybrid and comprehensive integration strategy:
    - **Frontend (SDK-driven)**: It extensively uses the `@mento-protocol/mento-sdk` for querying live exchange rates (`getAmountOut`) and orchestrating complex swap transactions, including pathfinding for multi-hop swaps (`getExchanges`, `findPairForTokens`, `getBroker`, `swapIn`). The SDK integration is robust, using `ethers.js` for provider/signer abstraction and `viem` for actual transaction signing.
    - **Smart Contracts (Direct/Custom Logic)**: The Solidity facets directly interact with ERC20 stablecoin contracts (`IERC20`) for transfers and approvals. They implement custom logic for managing multi-currency escrow amounts, tracking pending payments per token, and storing campaign-specific token information, all built upon the `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar` library which defines Mento token addresses and currency mappings.

## Security Analysis
- **Mento-specific security patterns**:
    - **Slippage Protection**: The `useCurrencySwap` hook explicitly incorporates `slippage` into the `expectedAmountOut` calculation when preparing swap transactions, protecting users from unfavorable price movements during execution.
    - **Token Approval Pattern**: The `useMultiCurrencyCampaignCreation` hook correctly implements the standard ERC20 `approve` pattern, requiring users to pre-approve the contract to spend their tokens before initiating a campaign, which is a best practice to prevent reentrancy and unauthorized spending.
    - **Reentrancy Protection**: The `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet` in the smart contract uses the `nonReentrant` modifier on `claimPaymentsInToken` and `claimAllPendingPayments` functions, safeguarding against reentrancy attacks during fund withdrawals.
    - **Supported Token Validation**: The `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.enforceTokenSupported` function is consistently used across Mento-related contract functions to ensure that only whitelisted Mento stablecoins are processed, preventing interactions with arbitrary or malicious tokens.
- **Input validation for swap parameters**: Frontend validation is present in `useCurrencySwap` to ensure the `amount` is valid (e.g., positive, not zero) before initiating a swap.
- **Oracle data validation**: The `frontend/lib/mento-live.ts` module implements caching for fetched exchange rates and includes fallback mechanisms to default rates in case of Mento SDK failures. This enhances resilience, though explicit on-chain oracle health checks or multi-oracle aggregation (beyond Mento's AMM) are not detailed.
- **Transaction security for Mento operations**: The use of `useWriteContractAsync` and `useWaitForTransactionReceipt` in frontend hooks ensures that Mento-related transactions are submitted and confirmed reliably, with appropriate loading and success/error states communicated to the user.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Mento core functionalities implemented**:
    - **Multi-Currency Campaign Creation**: Businesses can create campaigns using any of the 6 supported Mento stablecoins via `createAdBriefWithToken`.
    - **Multi-Currency Payment Claims**: Influencers can claim pending payments for specific Mento stablecoins (`claimPaymentsInToken`) or all available currencies at once (`claimAllPendingPayments`).
    - **Real-time Exchange Rate Display**: The UI components (`CurrencySelector`, `CurrencyConverter`, `MentoFXDemo`) display live exchange rates between Mento stablecoins, powered by the Mento Protocol's AMM.
    - **On-chain Stablecoin Swaps**: Users can perform direct swaps between Mento stablecoins through the `useCurrencySwap` hook, which interacts with the Mento Broker contract.
    - **Multi-Currency Escrow & Volume Tracking**: The smart contract tracks total escrowed funds and transaction volumes broken down by each Mento stablecoin (`getCampaignStatsByCurrency`).
- **Swap execution correctness**: The `useCurrencySwap` hook demonstrates a correct and robust implementation of Mento swaps. It handles:
    1.  ERC20 `approve` calls for the source token.
    2.  Fetching quotes from Mento's AMM.
    3.  Applying user-defined `slippage` to calculate `minAmountOut`.
    4.  Identifying optimal swap paths (single-hop or multi-hop) using `findPairForTokens`.
    5.  Executing the swap via the Mento Broker's `swapIn` function, abstracting away the underlying exchange provider.
    6.  Handling post-swap remittances if a different recipient is specified.
- **Error handling for Mento operations**: Frontend hooks incorporate comprehensive `try-catch` blocks to manage potential errors during Mento interactions (e.g., wallet not connected, insufficient balance, user rejection, transaction failures). The `parseSmartContractError` utility provides granular error messages for contract reverts.
- **Edge case handling for rate fluctuations**: Slippage protection is a key mechanism for handling rate fluctuations during swaps. Rate caching in `mento-live.ts` helps stabilize displayed rates against minor, rapid fluctuations.
- **Testing strategy for Mento features**: The project includes several frontend test scripts (`test-multicurrency.js`, `test-frontend-multicurrency.tsx`, `test-blockchain-operations.js`) that directly call and verify Mento-related functions and UI components. Smart contract unit and integration tests for multi-currency facets are mentioned (though some are commented out in the provided digest, a CI workflow `test.yml` exists).

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Mento SDK and library management**: The `@mento-protocol/mento-sdk` is a core dependency, managed via `npm` in `frontend/package.json`. Custom Solidity libraries (`LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol`) and facets (`MultiCurrencyCampaignFacet.sol`, `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet.sol`) are part of the `upgradeable-contract` project.
- **Installation process for Mento dependencies**: The `MENTO_MULTICURRENCY_INTEGRATION.md` and `frontend/package.json` outline standard `npm install` for frontend dependencies, including the Mento SDK. Smart contract dependencies are managed via Foundry/Hardhat.
- **Configuration approach for Mento networks**: Mento stablecoin addresses are hardcoded in `frontend/lib/mento-simple.ts` and `upgradeable-contract/contracts/libraries/LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol` for Celo Mainnet and Alfajores. The `DEFAULT_NETWORK` in `lib/networks.ts` determines the active network for contract interactions.
- **Deployment considerations for Mento integration**: The `upgradeable-contract/script/DeployUnifiedMultiCurrency.s.sol` script orchestrates the deployment of all necessary Diamond facets, including the Mento-specific ones. It also performs the `initializeMultiCurrency()` call on the deployed Diamond to set up the Mento token whitelist and mappings. This script ensures a unified, multi-currency-ready contract is deployed.

## Mento Protocol Integration Analysis

### 1. **Mento SDK Usage**
- **File Path**: `frontend/lib/mento-live.ts`, `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts`, `frontend/components/CurrencyConverter.tsx`, `frontend/components/CurrencySelector.tsx`, `frontend/components/MentoFXDemo.tsx`.
- **Implementation Quality**: Advanced.
- **Code Snippet**:
    ```typescript
    // frontend/lib/mento-live.ts
    import { Mento } from '@mento-protocol/mento-sdk';
    import { providers, BigNumber } from 'ethers';
    // ...
    const getMento = async (): Promise<Mento> => {
      if (!mentoInstance) {
        mentoInstance = await Mento.create(provider);
      }
      return mentoInstance;
    };
    // ...
    const amountOut = await mento.getAmountOut(fromToken.address, toToken.address, oneTokenInWei);
    ```
    ```typescript
    // frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts
    // ... inside useCurrencySwap
    const { Mento } = await import('@mento-protocol/mento-sdk');
    let mento = await Mento.create(signer);
    // ...
    exchanges = await mento.getExchanges();
    // ...
    quoteAmountOut = await mento.getAmountOut(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, amountInWei.toString());
    // ...
    const broker = await mento.getBroker();
    // ... broker.populateTransaction.swapIn(...)
    ```
- **Security Assessment**: The SDK is correctly initialized and used. The `mento-live.ts` implements caching, which is good for performance and reducing RPC calls. The `useCurrencySwap` hook correctly uses `ethers` for provider/signer compatibility with the Mento SDK, while delegating the actual transaction signing to `viem`, which is an advanced and secure pattern.

### 2. **Broker Contract Integration**
- **File Path**: `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts` (specifically `useCurrencySwap` and its helper functions `executeDirectSwap`, `executeMultiHopSwap`).
- **Implementation Quality**: Advanced.
- **Code Snippet**:
    ```typescript
    // frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts (inside useCurrencySwap)
    const broker = await mento.getBroker();
    // ...
    const tradablePair = await mento.findPairForTokens(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress);
    // ...
    // Direct swap:
    const txRequest = await broker.populateTransaction.swapIn(
      correctExchange.providerAddr,
      correctExchange.id,
      fromTokenAddress,
      toTokenAddress,
      amountInWei,
      expectedAmountOut
    );
    // Multi-hop swap logic also uses broker.populateTransaction.swapIn
    ```
- **Security Assessment**: The integration correctly identifies and uses the Broker contract for swap execution. It includes pathfinding logic for both single and multi-hop swaps, demonstrating a deep understanding of Mento's routing capabilities. Crucially, it calculates and enforces `amountOutMin` for slippage protection, which is a vital security measure against sandwich attacks and price impact. Token approval is handled before the swap.

### 3. **Oracle Integration (SortedOracles)**
- **File Path**: `frontend/lib/mento-live.ts`, `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts`, `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyBalances.ts`, `frontend/hooks/usePlatformStats.ts`.
- **Implementation Quality**: Advanced.
- **Code Snippet**:
    ```typescript
    // frontend/lib/mento-live.ts (inside getLiveExchangeRate)
    const mento = await getMento();
    const amountOut = await mento.getAmountOut(exchangePair.id, fromToken.address, toToken.address, oneTokenInWei);
    // ... includes caching and fallback rates
    ```
    ```typescript
    // frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyBalances.ts (inside getUSDValue)
    const rate = await getLiveExchangeRate(token, 'cUSD');
    ```
- **Security Assessment**: The project uses Mento Protocol's AMM directly as its price oracle via the SDK's `getAmountOut` function. This is a standard and reliable approach for Mento stablecoin pricing. The implementation includes caching to reduce RPC load and provides fallback mechanisms (returning 1:1) in case of API failures, which improves resilience, though a more sophisticated fallback (e.g., using a different oracle source) isn't explicitly detailed. There's no direct interaction with a `SortedOracles` contract, as the Mento SDK abstracts this by interacting with the AMM directly.

### 4. **Stable Asset & Token Integration**
- **File Path**: `frontend/lib/mento-simple.ts`, `upgradeable-contract/contracts/libraries/LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol`, `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts`, `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyBalances.ts`, `frontend/components/header/header.tsx`, `frontend/components/modals/CreateCampaignModal.tsx`.
- **Implementation Quality**: Advanced.
- **Code Snippet**:
    ```typescript
    // frontend/lib/mento-simple.ts
    export const MENTO_TOKENS = {
      cUSD: { address: '0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a', symbol: 'cUSD', ... },
      cEUR: { address: '0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73', symbol: 'cEUR', ... },
      // ... all 6 stablecoins
    } as const;
    ```
    ```solidity
    // upgradeable-contract/contracts/libraries/LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol
    address constant CUSD_ADDRESS = 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a;
    // ... other stablecoin addresses
    mapping(address => bool) supportedTokens;
    mapping(SupportedCurrency => address) currencyToAddress;
    // ...
    function enforceTokenSupported(address tokenAddress) internal view {
        require(isTokenSupported(tokenAddress), "Token not supported");
    }
    ```
- **Security Assessment**: All 6 Mento stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, cKES, eXOF, cNGN) are explicitly defined and whitelisted both in the frontend (`MENTO_TOKENS`) and on-chain (`LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol`). The system correctly handles ERC20 token standards for transfers and approvals. The `enforceTokenSupported` mechanism on-chain is crucial for preventing interactions with unauthorized tokens, enhancing security.

### 5. **Advanced Mento Features**
- **File Path**: `frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts` (specifically `useCurrencySwap`).
- **Implementation Quality**: Advanced.
- **Code Snippet**:
    ```typescript
    // frontend/hooks/useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.ts (inside useCurrencySwap)
    const tradablePair = await mento.findPairForTokens(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress);
    if (tradablePair.path.length === 1) { /* execute direct swap */ }
    else if (tradablePair.path.length === 2) { /* execute multi-hop swap */ }
    ```
- **Security Assessment**: The implementation of multi-hop swaps is a sophisticated feature, allowing for more complex routing to achieve optimal exchange rates even if a direct pair is not the most liquid. While other advanced features like liquidity provision or arbitrage are not explicitly implemented *by this project*, the foundation for robust trading is clearly laid out. The handling of allowances and slippage within these complex swaps is a strong security practice.

### 6. **Implementation Quality Assessment**

-   **Architecture**: 8.5/10. The use of the EIP-2535 Diamond pattern for smart contracts is an advanced and flexible architectural choice. Frontend hooks (`useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar`, `usePlatformStats`, etc.) effectively encapsulate blockchain logic, promoting modularity and reusability. The separation of Mento-specific logic into `lib/mento-live.ts` and `lib/mento-simple.ts` is also well-structured.
-   **Error Handling**: 8.0/10. Frontend hooks include `try-catch` blocks and provide user-friendly `toast` messages for various failure scenarios (wallet not connected, insufficient funds, user rejection). The `parseSmartContractError` utility attempts to extract meaningful revert reasons. On-chain, `require` statements are used for precondition checks.
-   **Gas Optimization**: 7.5/10. While the Diamond pattern itself can introduce some gas overhead due to delegatecall, the use of `view` functions where possible and the batching of data fetches (e.g., in `usePlatformStats`) contribute to efficiency. The explicit handling of token approvals before transfers is also a good practice. No extreme low-level optimizations (assembly for gas) are evident, but the overall design avoids obvious gas-heavy patterns.
-   **Security**: 8.5/10. Strong focus on Mento-specific security patterns like slippage protection, correct ERC20 approval flows, and on-chain whitelisting of stablecoins. The `nonReentrant` guard is used for critical payment functions. Input validation is present on the frontend, and contract `require` statements enforce business logic.
-   **Testing**: 7.0/10. The project includes numerous frontend test scripts (`test-multicurrency.js`, `test-frontend-multicurrency.tsx`) that demonstrate functional testing of Mento features. A CI workflow (`test.yml`) exists for Foundry. However, the presence of commented-out tests in `contract/test/AdsBazaar.t.sol` and the mention of build issues in `BUILD_STATUS.md` suggest that the test suite might not be fully comprehensive or consistently maintained to production standards.
-   **Documentation**: 7.0/10. The project has extensive READMEs explaining Mento integration, architecture, and usage examples. However, the information is somewhat fragmented across multiple files, and some inconsistencies (e.g., number of supported stablecoins) exist. A dedicated and consolidated documentation site would improve clarity.

## Mento Protocol Integration Summary

### Features Used:
- **Mento SDK Usage**:
    - `@mento-protocol/mento-sdk` version `^1.10.3`.
    - `Mento.create(provider)` for SDK initialization using `ethers.js` provider.
    - `mento.getExchanges()` for exchange discovery.
    - `mento.getAmountOut()` for real-time price quotes (oracle).
    - `mento.findPairForTokens()` for multi-hop swap pathfinding.
    - `mento.getBroker()` for direct interaction with the Broker contract.
    - `broker.populateTransaction.swapIn()` for constructing swap transactions.
- **Broker Contract Integration**:
    - Direct interaction with the Mento Broker contract (address obtained via `mento.getBroker()`).
    - Usage of `swapIn()` interface for executing both single-hop and multi-hop stablecoin swaps.
    - Implementation includes `amountOutMin` for slippage protection.
    - Handles ERC20 `approve` pattern for spending tokens by the Broker.
- **Oracle Implementation**:
    - Mento Protocol's AMM is used as the primary price oracle, accessed via `mento.getAmountOut()`.
    - `frontend/lib/mento-live.ts` implements caching for fetched rates and provides fallback mechanisms.
- **Stable Asset & Token Integration**:
    - Supports all 6 Celo Mento stablecoins: cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, cKES, eXOF, cNGN.
    - On-chain whitelisting and mapping of these tokens in `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol`.
    - ERC20 compliance for token transfers and approvals.
    - Tracking of total escrow and volume per stablecoin.
- **Advanced Mento Features**:
    - **Multi-hop Swaps**: The `useCurrencySwap` hook intelligently identifies and executes multi-hop swaps when a direct pair is not optimal or available, demonstrating advanced routing capabilities.
    - **Slippage Protection**: Implemented for all swaps with a configurable slippage tolerance.
- **Custom Implementations/Workarounds**:
    - Custom Solidity library `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar.sol` to manage Mento token addresses, mappings, and enforce supported tokens on-chain.
    - Custom Solidity facets (`MultiCurrencyCampaignFacet.sol`, `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet.sol`) to build Mento-aware campaign and payment logic directly into the Diamond contract.
    - Frontend `ethers.js` provider with `viem` signer abstraction for Mento SDK compatibility.

### Implementation Quality:
- **Code Organization**: Mento-related logic is well-organized into dedicated frontend hooks and Solidity facets/libraries, promoting modularity. However, the proliferation of multiple detailed READMEs could be consolidated.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is present in frontend hooks, with meaningful `toast` messages for users and detailed console logging for developers. On-chain `require` statements enforce critical preconditions.
- **Edge Case Management**: Slippage protection addresses price volatility. Caching and fallback rates for the oracle improve resilience. The `nonReentrant` guard protects against reentrancy.
- **Security Practices**: Strong adherence to Mento-specific security patterns (slippage, approvals) and general blockchain security (reentrancy guards, input validation, token whitelisting).

### Best Practices Adherence:
- **Adherence to Mento Documentation**: The project aligns well with Mento SDK usage and best practices for interacting with the Broker and fetching rates.
- **Deviations from Recommended Patterns**: The `mento-live.ts` module uses `ethers.js` for the provider/signer while `viem` is the primary client for other interactions. While this is a functional abstraction, a fully `viem`-native Mento integration would be ideal if available.
- **Innovative/Exemplary Approaches**: The comprehensive on-chain multi-currency support via a custom Solidity library and facets within a Diamond architecture is exemplary. The implementation of multi-hop swaps and the explicit handling of `ethers`/`viem` interoperability for the SDK are also noteworthy.

## Recommendations for Improvement

-   **High Priority**:
    1.  **Consolidate Documentation**: Merge fragmented READMEs into a single, well-structured documentation site or a central `docs/` directory. Ensure consistency in information (e.g., number of supported stablecoins).
    2.  **Complete Smart Contract Test Suite**: Prioritize writing comprehensive unit and integration tests for all Solidity facets, especially the Mento-related ones. The commented-out tests in `contract/test/AdsBazaar.t.sol` should be reactivated and expanded.
    3.  **Address Frontend Build Issues**: Investigate and resolve the TypeScript complexity, large dependency resolution, and circular dependency issues reported in `BUILD_STATUS.md` to ensure a smooth and reliable production build process.
    4.  **Implement License**: Add a `LICENSE` file to clarify usage rights for the project.
-   **Medium Priority**:
    1.  **Implement CI/CD for All Tests**: Ensure the existing `test.yml` workflow runs all relevant tests (Foundry tests, frontend unit tests, integration tests) and provides clear feedback on build status.
    2.  **Add Contribution Guidelines**: Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to encourage and guide community contributions.
    3.  **Enhance Oracle Resilience**: While caching and fallbacks are present, consider integrating with an additional independent price oracle (e.g., Chainlink) for critical operations, or implement on-chain validation for Mento's AMM data (e.g., checking median rates against a trusted source).
-   **Low Priority**:
    1.  **Frontend Wallet Connection**: Provide a more explicit and user-friendly experience for switching networks within the UI, especially for Farcaster frame users who might not be able to switch directly via the dApp.
    2.  **Gas Optimization Review**: Conduct a detailed gas usage analysis for critical on-chain functions, especially those involving loops or complex data structures, to identify further optimization opportunities.
    3.  **Containerization**: Provide Dockerfiles for both frontend and smart contract environments to streamline development and deployment setup.
-   **Mento-Specific**:
    1.  **Explore Mento Broker Discovery**: While `getExchanges()` is used, explore more dynamic ways to discover and select optimal exchange providers, especially if new types of Mento exchanges or liquidity pools emerge.
    2.  **Multi-Currency Analytics on-chain**: Expand `getCampaignStatsByCurrency` to include more granular data (e.g., number of active campaigns per currency, average budget per currency) for richer insights.
    3.  **FiatConnect Integration (Deep Dive)**: The project mentions FiatConnect API, Kotani Pay, and Alchemy Pay. Deepen the integration to handle fiat-to-crypto flows more robustly, including real-time provider selection, KYC integration, and transaction tracking.

## Technical Assessment from Senior Blockchain Developer Perspective
The AdsBazaar project demonstrates an **exceptionally strong technical foundation** for Mento Protocol integration. The architecture, leveraging the EIP-2535 Diamond pattern, is a sophisticated choice that provides modularity and upgradeability, crucial for a complex multi-currency platform. The implementation of Mento SDK for live exchange rates and comprehensive swap functionality, including multi-hop routing and robust slippage protection, showcases a deep understanding of the protocol's capabilities. The custom on-chain multi-currency library and facets are well-designed to manage stable assets.

From a production readiness standpoint, the core Mento integration is highly mature and functional. The project actively addresses security concerns specific to stablecoin swaps (reentrancy, approvals, token whitelisting). However, the noted weaknesses in documentation consistency, potentially incomplete testing (especially for smart contracts), and reported frontend build complexities suggest that while the **blockchain-centric Mento integration is innovative and robust**, the overall project lifecycle management and developer experience could benefit from further polish to reach enterprise-grade production readiness. The innovation factor is high due to its pioneering focus on native multi-currency influencer marketing using Mento stablecoins, solving a tangible problem for a global user base.
