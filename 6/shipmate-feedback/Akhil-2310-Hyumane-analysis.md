## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal**: To create a social media platform, "Hyumane," focused on fostering real human connections.
- **Problem solved**: Addresses the proliferation of AI bots and fake content on existing social media platforms by enforcing zero-knowledge (zk) proof-based human verification for every profile.
- **Target users/beneficiaries**: Individuals seeking authentic digital interactions and a bot-free online community.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (predominant), JavaScript, CSS.
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code**:
    - **Frontend**: React, Next.js (App Router)
    - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
    - **Backend/Database**: Supabase (used as BaaS for database, storage, and real-time features)
    - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Self Protocol (`@selfxyz/core`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`)
    - **Utilities**: `uuid` for generating unique IDs.
- **Inferred runtime environment(s)**: Node.js for Next.js server-side operations and API routes, browser for client-side React. Supabase handles the database and storage backend.

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed**: The project follows the Next.js App Router convention.
    - `app/`: Contains all page components (`page.tsx`) and API routes (`api/`).
    - `lib/`: Houses utility functions, specifically `supabase-actions.ts` for database interactions and `supabase.ts` for Supabase client initialization.
    - Configuration files (`eslint.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`) are at the root.
- **Key modules/components and their roles**:
    - `app/layout.tsx`: Root layout for the Next.js application, including global CSS and font configuration.
    - `app/page.tsx`: Landing page for the application, handling initial user routing based on verification and profile status.
    - `app/verify/page.tsx`: Handles the core human verification process using Self.xyz, displaying a QR code for scanning.
    - `app/create-profile/page.tsx`: Allows verified users to set up their profile (username, bio, interests, avatar).
    - `app/feed/page.tsx`: The main social feed displaying posts, with functionality for creating posts, liking, replying, and following.
    - `app/discover/page.tsx`: Enables users to find and connect with other verified users.
    - `app/chat/page.tsx`: Provides direct messaging functionality with real-time updates.
    - `app/profile/page.tsx`: Displays and allows editing of the current user's profile.
    - `app/api/verify/route.ts`: Next.js API route that acts as the backend endpoint for Self.xyz verification callbacks.
    - `lib/supabase-actions.ts`: Contains all Supabase database interaction logic (CRUD for profiles, posts, likes, replies, follows, chats, messages, and avatar uploads).
    - `lib/supabase.ts`: Initializes the Supabase client.
- **Code organization assessment**: The organization is logical for a Next.js project. Separation of concerns is generally good, with UI components in `app/` and data access logic in `lib/`. However, the `lib/supabase-actions.ts` file is quite large and could benefit from further modularization (e.g., `lib/profiles.ts`, `lib/posts.ts`, `lib/chats.ts`).

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms**:
    - **Verification**: Uses Self.xyz for initial human verification, which is a strong point for preventing bots.
    - **Session Management**: After Self.xyz verification, `localStorage` is used to store `userId` and `isVerified`. This `userId` is then used in client-side Supabase actions (e.g., `createPost`, `sendMessage`, `followUser`).
    - **Authorization**: There is **no explicit server-side authorization** based on user identity for most Supabase actions. All Supabase calls are made directly from the client using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. This means that if Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) is not robustly configured on the database side, a malicious user could spoof their `userId` in `localStorage` and perform actions (e.g., create posts as another user, modify other users' profiles, read private chats) by directly calling the Supabase API. This is a critical vulnerability.
- **Data validation and sanitization**:
    - Basic `trim()` is used for string inputs (e.g., post content).
    - No explicit server-side input validation beyond `trim()` is visible in `supabase-actions.ts`. Frontend validation is present (e.g., `!newPost.trim()`).
    - User-generated content is displayed directly in React components. While React generally mitigates basic XSS, server-side sanitization of user inputs (e.g., using a library like `DOMPurify` on the backend) is a best practice, especially for rich text or if content might be rendered in non-React contexts.
- **Potential vulnerabilities**:
    - **Authorization Bypass (Critical)**: As noted above, the reliance on a client-provided `userId` for Supabase actions without strong RLS enforcement is a severe vulnerability. The `supabase-actions.ts` functions directly use the `userId` passed from the client, assuming it's legitimate.
    - **CORS Misconfiguration**: The `/api/verify` endpoint sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. While sometimes necessary for public APIs, it's generally safer to restrict this to known origins if possible.
    - **Lack of Rate Limiting**: No evidence of rate limiting on API routes or direct Supabase calls, which could make the application vulnerable to spamming, brute-force attacks, or denial-of-service.
    - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: User profile data (username, bio, interests, avatar_url) is fetched for all users in `getAllUsers`. While this is intended for a "discover" feature, ensure no truly sensitive user data is exposed.
- **Secret management approach**: Supabase API keys are managed via environment variables (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`). These are client-side public keys, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of server-side secrets (e.g., Supabase `service_role` key) being used, which reinforces the RLS concern.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented**:
    - **Human Verification**: Integration with Self.xyz for ZK-proof based identity verification.
    - **Profile Management**: Create and edit user profiles (username, bio, interests, avatar).
    - **Social Feed**: Displaying posts, creating new posts, liking/unliking posts, replying to posts.
    - **User Discovery**: Browse and search for other verified users.
    - **Following/Unfollowing**: Establish social connections.
    - **Direct Messaging**: One-to-one chat functionality with real-time updates.
- **Error handling approach**: Basic `try-catch` blocks are present in most asynchronous operations on both frontend and API routes. Errors are typically logged to the console and sometimes result in redirects or generic error messages to the user. More specific user-facing error messages and feedback (e.g., toast notifications) would improve UX.
- **Edge case handling**:
    - Handles unverified users by redirecting to the verification page.
    - Handles verified users without profiles by redirecting to profile creation.
    - Displays messages for empty feeds, chat lists, or search results.
    - Optimistic UI updates are implemented for likes, follows, and post creation, improving perceived responsiveness.
- **Testing strategy**: The GitHub metrics explicitly state "Missing tests." No test files or testing frameworks are visible in the digest. This is a significant gap for ensuring correctness and preventing regressions.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency**: The code generally follows consistent style, likely enforced by ESLint (configured with `next/core-web-vitals`, `next/typescript`). JSX formatting, variable naming, and function structure are consistent.
- **Documentation quality**: The `README.md` is excellent, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the project's mission, problem, solution, future plans, and technology stack. However, there is a complete lack of inline code comments, JSDoc, or a dedicated documentation directory, which makes understanding complex logic or specific function parameters harder without diving deep into the implementation.
- **Naming conventions**: Variable, function, and component names are generally clear and descriptive (e.g., `handleLaunchApp`, `checkUserSession`, `getPosts`).
- **Complexity management**: Frontend components (pages) can be quite large due to the amount of state and logic. While data fetching is abstracted into `supabase-actions.ts`, this file itself is growing in complexity. Breaking down larger components into smaller, more focused ones and modularizing `supabase-actions.ts` would improve maintainability.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach**: Standard npm/yarn approach using `package.json`. Dependencies are up-to-date (e.g., Next.js 14.2.28).
- **Installation process**: Implied standard Next.js setup: `npm install` (or `yarn install`), then `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`). No explicit installation guide beyond the `README`'s "Join Us" section.
- **Configuration approach**: Environment variables (`.env`) are used for Supabase keys. Next.js, ESLint, and PostCSS have their respective configuration files (`next.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`).
- **Deployment considerations**: The `hyumane.vercel.app` endpoint in `app/api/verify/route.ts` suggests deployment on Vercel, which is a common and straightforward platform for Next.js applications. The GitHub metrics indicate "No CI/CD configuration," which means deployments are likely manual or triggered by pushing to a specific branch (e.g., main) without automated tests or checks. Containerization (e.g., Dockerfile) is also missing.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration**:
    - **Next.js**: Excellent use of the App Router, client components, server components (implicitly for `layout.tsx` and API routes), and image optimization. `next/navigation` for routing is correctly used.
    - **React**: Standard and effective use of functional components, `useState`, `useEffect` for local state management and side effects. `Suspense` is used for loading states.
    - **Supabase**: Comprehensive integration for database operations (CRUD), file storage (avatars), and real-time features (likes, replies, chat messages). The use of `supabase.rpc` for `get_or_create_chat` indicates a good understanding of leveraging Supabase's capabilities.
    - **Self.xyz**: Correct integration of the Self SDK for ZK-proof based human verification, including `SelfAppBuilder`, `SelfQRcodeWrapper`, and `SelfBackendVerifier` on the API route.
    - **Tailwind CSS**: Seamlessly integrated for styling, demonstrating component-based styling.
2.  **API Design and Implementation**:
    - The `app/api/verify/route.ts` demonstrates a functional Next.js API route. It correctly handles `POST` and `OPTIONS` requests. Error responses are well-structured with `status`, `result`, `reason`, and `error_code`.
    - Most other "backend" operations are direct Supabase calls from the client, which is a common pattern with BaaS like Supabase, but shifts the security burden heavily onto RLS.
3.  **Database Interactions**:
    - `supabase-actions.ts` shows a good grasp of Supabase client methods (`select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `eq`, `order`, `maybeSingle`, `rpc`, `storage`).
    - Real-time subscriptions are effectively used for chat messages, likes, and replies, providing a dynamic user experience.
    - **Major Weakness**: The `getPosts`, `getChats`, and `getMessages` functions suffer from **N+1 query issues**. For example, `getPosts` fetches posts, then iterates through *each* post to fetch its author's profile, like count, and reply count individually. This leads to a large number of redundant database queries, significantly impacting performance as the number of posts grows. This should be optimized using Supabase `JOIN` clauses or by creating database views/functions that return aggregated data.
4.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    - UI components are well-structured and functional, built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
    - State management is handled locally within components using `useState`. User session data (verification status, user ID) is persisted in `localStorage`.
    - Optimistic UI updates for social interactions (likes, follows, posts) are a strong positive, enhancing user experience.
    - Basic responsive design seems to be considered through Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., `md:grid-cols-2`).
5.  **Performance Optimization**:
    - Optimistic UI updates and Supabase real-time subscriptions are excellent for perceived performance.
    - Image uploads use `cacheControl`.
    - However, the N+1 query issue in data fetching functions (`getPosts`, `getChats`, `getMessages`) is a significant actual performance bottleneck that needs addressing.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Implement Robust Authorization with Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)**: This is the most critical security improvement. Configure RLS policies on all Supabase tables (`profiles`, `posts`, `likes`, `replies`, `follows`, `chats`, `messages`) to ensure users can only access/modify data they own or are authorized to interact with. This is crucial given the client-side `userId` reliance.
2.  **Introduce a Comprehensive Test Suite**: Add unit tests for `lib/supabase-actions.ts` functions to ensure data integrity and correct behavior. Implement integration tests for API routes and end-to-end tests for critical user flows (verification, profile creation, posting, chatting) using tools like Playwright or Cypress.
3.  **Optimize Database Queries (Address N+1 Problem)**: Refactor `getPosts`, `getChats`, and `getMessages` functions to use Supabase `JOIN` operations (if applicable via `select` with foreign table relationships) or create custom PostgreSQL functions/views (RPCs) to fetch all necessary related data in a single, efficient query. This will drastically improve performance for fetching lists of items.
4.  **Enhance User Feedback and Error Handling**: Provide more specific and user-friendly error messages on the frontend using toast notifications or dedicated error components, rather than just console logs or redirects. For example, if a post fails to send, inform the user why.
5.  **Improve Code Documentation and Maintainability**: Add JSDoc comments to functions in `lib/supabase-actions.ts` explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Consider breaking `supabase-actions.ts` into smaller, domain-specific files (e.g., `profile-actions.ts`, `post-actions.ts`, `chat-actions.ts`).

**Potential Future Development Directions**:
- Implement the planned V2 features: AI content detection and expanded ZK use-cases (content authorship, voting).
- Introduce a notification system for new messages, likes, or replies.
- Implement pagination for feeds and chat messages to handle large datasets more efficiently.
- Explore user blocking/reporting features to maintain a healthy community.
- Add user search by interests or bio to the discover page.
