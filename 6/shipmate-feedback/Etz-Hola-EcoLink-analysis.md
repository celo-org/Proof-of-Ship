## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 5.0/10 | Frontend uses mock authentication, lacking real backend security. Smart contracts leverage OpenZeppelin's AccessControl but no audit evidence. Secret management (env vars) is standard but needs production-grade solutions. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 6.5/10 | Core features are well-defined, but frontend implementations rely heavily on mocks for critical parts like authentication, material processing, and logistics. Smart contracts implement the core logic for EcoPoints, NFTs, and payments. Lack of comprehensive frontend tests and basic smart contract tests reduces confidence. |
| Readability & Understandability | 8.5/10 | Excellent use of TypeScript, clear React component structure, and consistent Tailwind CSS styling. Helper functions are well-organized. Smart contracts are modular with clear interfaces and a library. Code is generally easy to follow. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 5.5/10 | `package.json` and configuration files are well-structured. However, critical project documentation like `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and contribution guidelines are missing. The presence of a duplicate `SmartContract/FrontEndTesti` directory indicates poor project hygiene. No CI/CD setup. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 7.0/10 | Good application of modern frontend practices (React hooks, Context API, Tailwind, React Query). Smart contract development uses industry standards (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin). Web3 integration with `wagmi`/`viem` (though `WalletContext` in the main frontend uses a more direct `window.ethereum` approach, while the test frontend uses `web3modal`). Cloudinary integration is a practical choice for image handling. |
| **Overall Score** | 6.5/10 | Weighted average based on the above criteria. |

- Configuration file examples (e.g., `.env.example`).
- Containerization setup (e.g., Dockerfiles).

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** To create a smart recycling platform, EcoLink, that connects waste collectors, processors (branches), and buyers, facilitating the recycling process and incentivizing participation through financial earnings and blockchain-based rewards (EcoPoints and NFTs).
- **Problem solved:** Addresses inefficient waste management and lack of incentives for recycling, particularly in Nigeria, by providing a transparent, digitized platform for material exchange and value realization.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** Individual waste collectors, recycling branches/organizations, bulk material buyers, and potentially administrators managing the platform.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript (95.04%), Solidity (2.25%), JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:**
    - **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, React Query (@tanstack/react-query), Yup (@hookform/resolvers), React Hook Form, Lucide React (icons), Wagmi, Viem. Cloudinary (for image uploads).
    - **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin Contracts (`ERC20`, `ERC721`, `AccessControl`).
    - **Web3 Integration:** `wagmi`, `viem`, `ethers`, `web3modal`, `@walletconnect/web3-provider`, `@coinbase/wallet-sdk` (the last three are present in `SmartContract/FrontEndTesti/package.json` but not the main `FrontEnd/package.json`, which indicates a potential evolution or inconsistency in Web3 integration strategy).
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js for development and build processes (both frontend and smart contracts). Web browsers for the frontend application. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain (specifically Celo, as configured in `hardhat.config.ts`) for smart contract execution.

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** The project is divided into two main top-level directories: `FrontEnd/` and `SmartContract/`. This clearly separates the client-side application from the blockchain-based backend.
    - `FrontEnd/`: Contains the React/TypeScript application code, including components (common, feature, layout, web2, web3), context providers, custom hooks, pages, routing, types, and utility functions.
    - `SmartContract/`: Contains the Hardhat project for Solidity smart contracts, including contracts, interfaces, libraries, deployment scripts, and tests. A notable redundancy is the `SmartContract/FrontEndTesti/` directory, which appears to be a copy of the main `FrontEnd/` folder, indicating a lack of clear separation or cleanup.
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - **Frontend:**
        - `src/App.tsx`: Main application entry, setting up React Query, Auth, Wallet, and App contexts, and React Router.
        - `src/context/`: `AuthContext`, `WalletContext`, `AppContext` for global state management (user authentication, wallet connection, application data like materials/branches).
        - `src/hooks/`: Custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useWallet`, `useMaterial`, `useLogistics`, `useQuality`) encapsulate business logic and data fetching.
        - `src/components/common/`: Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Loader, Modal).
        - `src/components/feature/`: Feature-specific components (LogisticsScheduler, MaterialCard, PriceCalculator, QualityGrader).
        - `src/components/layout/`: Layout components (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer).
        - `src/components/web2/`: Traditional web2 forms (LoginForm, RegisterForm).
        - `src/components/web3/`: Web3-specific UI (EcoPointsDisplay, WalletConnect, RecycleHubABI.json).
        - `src/pages/`: Main application views (Landing, Home, Dashboards, Upload, Profile, Logistics, NotFound).
        - `src/types/`: TypeScript interfaces for data models (User, Material, Branch, etc.).
        - `src/utils/`: Utility functions (helpers, constants).
    - **Smart Contracts:**
        - `contracts/`: Solidity contracts (`RecycleHub`, `EcoPoints`, `RecycleNFT`, `MockCUSD`, `Lock` - a sample).
        - `contracts/Interfaces/`: Interfaces for external contracts (`IEcoPoints`, `IRecycleNFT`, `IRecycleHub`).
        - `contracts/libraries/`: Solidity library (`MaterialLib`) for enums.
        - `scripts/`: Deployment, interaction, and role seeding scripts.
        - `test/`: Hardhat tests for contracts.
- **Code organization assessment:**
    - The frontend is well-organized following a feature/domain-driven approach within the `src` directory, using clear component categories and context/hook patterns for state and logic.
    - The smart contract project adheres to standard Hardhat project structure.
    - The main architectural concern is the lack of a visible backend API implementation. The frontend mocks these interactions, implying a missing server-side component for user management, persistent material data, and complex business logic not handled by smart contracts.
    - The duplication of the frontend code within the `SmartContract` directory (`SmartContract/FrontEndTesti`) is a significant organizational issue, indicating potential confusion or uncleaned development artifacts.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:**
    - **Frontend:** Authentication (`AuthContext`) is currently mocked (`demo@ecolink.ng`, `password`). This is a major security gap for a production application as it lacks real user validation, password hashing, token generation/validation, and secure session management. Authorization is handled client-side by checking `user.role` (e.g., in `Sidebar.tsx`).
    - **Smart Contracts:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` for role-based access control (RBAC) (`COLLECTOR_ROLE`, `BRANCH_ROLE`, `BUYER_ROLE`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`). This is a robust and widely-audited solution for on-chain authorization. `EcoPoints` and `RecycleNFT` contracts use `Ownable` to restrict minting to the `RecycleHub` contract, which is a good design.
- **Data validation and sanitization:**
    - **Frontend:** Client-side validation is implemented for forms (e.g., `MaterialUpload.tsx` checks for required fields, image file types/sizes; `RegisterForm.tsx` checks password match and length). This is good for UX but insufficient for security without server-side validation.
    - **Smart Contracts:** Basic input validation is present in `RecycleHub.sol` (e.g., `InvalidWeight`, `InvalidPrice` reverts).
- **Potential vulnerabilities:**
    - **Frontend:**
        - **Auth Bypass:** Due to mocked authentication, a real backend would be susceptible to various attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, brute-force) if not properly implemented.
        - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** If material/logistics IDs are sequential and not properly authorized on the backend, users could access/manipulate data they shouldn't.
        - **Sensitive Data Exposure:** No explicit handling for sensitive user data beyond local storage (which is not secure for tokens/user details).
        - **API Key Exposure:** `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` and `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` are hardcoded in `utils/constants.ts` and used directly in `uploadToCloudinary`. While presets are generally safe, hardcoding cloud names isn't ideal, and any sensitive Cloudinary API keys are not visible but would need secure handling.
    - **Smart Contracts:**
        - **Reentrancy:** Not immediately apparent in the provided contract snippets, but always a concern with external calls (e.g., `paymentToken.transferFrom`). The current `processPayment` uses `transferFrom` which is generally safer than direct `transfer` followed by `call`, but full reentrancy guard is not explicitly used.
        - **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.x automatically checks for this, mitigating many common issues.
        - **Access Control Issues:** While `AccessControl` is used, the exact role assignments and their implications would need thorough testing to ensure no unintended access.
        - **Front-running:** For price-sensitive operations, front-running could be a concern if not mitigated (e.g., through commit-reveal schemes or TWAP oracles). Not directly visible in the current simplified pricing.
- **Secret management approach:**
    - **Frontend:** Relies on environment variables loaded via Vite (`import.meta.env`). For Cloudinary, `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` and `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` are used. No explicit sensitive API keys are visible in the provided frontend code that would be directly exposed client-side.
    - **Smart Contracts:** `hardhat.config.ts` uses `process.env.PRIVATE_KEY` for deployment accounts, which is standard practice but requires secure handling of the `.env` file in production environments. Celo API key for Etherscan verification is also from environment variables.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:**
    - **User Management (Mocked):** Registration, Login, Logout, Profile Update.
    - **Material Management:** Uploading materials with details and photos, viewing user's materials, filtering by status. Branch users can review, accept/reject, and grade materials.
    - **Price Calculation:** Client-side calculation based on material type, weight, condition, and quality grade (mocked values).
    - **Logistics:** Scheduling pickups (mocked logistics options and data storage), tracking request status.
    - **Web3 Integration (Partial/Mocked):** Wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase via Web3Modal in `FrontEndTesti`, direct `window.ethereum` in main `FrontEnd`), EcoPoints display (mocked, but intended to reflect on-chain tokens), NFT certificates (mocked, but intended to reflect on-chain NFTs).
    - **Smart Contract Core:** `RecycleHub` facilitates material uploads, verification (issuing EcoPoints and NFTs), and payment processing (cUSD). `EcoPoints` (ERC20) and `RecycleNFT` (ERC721) tokens.
- **Error handling approach:**
    - **Frontend:** Basic error state management in forms and hooks (e.g., `setError`, `isLoading` states). Modals are used to display errors. Global error state in `AppContext`.
    - **Smart Contracts:** Uses Solidity `revert` with custom errors (e.g., `MaterialNotFound`, `InsufficientFunds`, `UnauthorizedRole`, `OnlyRecycleHub`), which is a modern and gas-efficient approach.
- **Edge case handling:**
    - **Frontend:** Basic edge cases like empty photo uploads, invalid image files, password mismatch, and zero weight are handled with client-side validation.
    - **Smart Contracts:** Handles zero weight, zero price, material not found, material already verified, insufficient funds, and unauthorized roles.
- **Testing strategy:**
    - **Frontend:** No dedicated test files are provided for the frontend. The `FrontEndTesti` directory seems to be a duplicate of the main frontend, not a separate testing environment.
    - **Smart Contracts:** Basic unit tests are present for `Lock.sol` (sample contract), `RecycleHub.sol`, `EcoPoints.sol`, and `RecycleNFT.sol` using Hardhat and Chai. These tests cover core functionality and role-based access. However, the test coverage appears limited for a production-ready system (e.g., no fuzzing, property-based testing, or extensive edge-case testing).

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** Highly consistent. Frontend uses a clear React/TypeScript component-based architecture with functional components and hooks. Tailwind CSS is applied consistently for styling. Smart contracts follow Solidity style guides and OpenZeppelin patterns.
- **Documentation quality:**
    - **Inline Comments:** Good use of inline comments, especially in complex logic or for explaining component props. Smart contracts also have comments.
    - **Missing Project-level Documentation:** A significant weakness is the absence of a `README.md` file, which is critical for onboarding new developers, explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage. No dedicated `docs/` directory.
- **Naming conventions:** Clear and descriptive naming conventions are used for variables, functions, components, and contracts (e.g., `useAuth`, `MaterialCard`, `RecycleHub`, `handleInputChange`). TypeScript interfaces (`User`, `Material`, `AppState`) contribute to clarity.
- **Complexity management:**
    - **Frontend:** Complexity is managed well through modular components, custom hooks to abstract logic, and Context API for global state. Routing is handled by `react-router-dom`.
    - **Smart Contracts:** Contracts are broken down into logical units (`RecycleHub` as the main hub, separate ERC20/ERC721 tokens), using interfaces and a library (`MaterialLib`) for better organization and reusability. This helps manage the complexity of on-chain logic.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** `package.json` files are used in both `FrontEnd` and `SmartContract` directories, listing dependencies and dev dependencies. `npm` or `yarn` would be used for package management.
- **Installation process:** Inferred from `package.json` and `hardhat.config.ts`:
    - Frontend: `npm install` or `yarn install`, followed by `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
    - Smart Contracts: `npm install` or `yarn install`, then `npx hardhat compile`, `npx hardhat deploy`, etc.
    - Missing a top-level `README.md` makes this process unclear for a new contributor.
- **Configuration approach:**
    - **Frontend:** Uses `vite.config.ts` for build configuration and environment variables via `import.meta.env`. Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. ESLint is configured with `eslint.config.js`.
    - **Smart Contracts:** Uses `hardhat.config.ts` for network configuration (including Celo testnet/mainnet), Solidity compiler versions, and named accounts. Environment variables are used for private keys and Etherscan API keys.
- **Deployment considerations:**
    - **Frontend:** `vite build` command is available for production builds. No explicit hosting/deployment configuration (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Docker).
    - **Smart Contracts:** Hardhat provides deployment scripts (`scripts/deploy.ts`) and `hardhat-deploy` for managing deployments across networks. Celo-specific configurations are present in `hardhat.config.ts`. The `cUSDAddressBytes` in `deploy.ts` and the comment about bypassing checksum validation for Celo indicate specific considerations for the Celo network. The `Lock.ts` module in `ignition/modules` is a sample, not core to EcoLink.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration:**
    *   **React & Hooks:** Extensive and correct use of React functional components, `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useWallet`, etc.) to manage component state and logic.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Effectively used for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development and consistent design without writing custom CSS. Custom colors, spacing, animations, and utilities are defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
    *   **React Query:** Used in `App.tsx` for data fetching and caching, indicating an understanding of efficient data management in React applications.
    *   **Hardhat & OpenZeppelin:** Proper setup of a Hardhat project, including multiple Solidity compiler versions, network configurations (Celo), and integration of OpenZeppelin contracts for secure and standard token/access control implementations.
    *   **Wagmi/Viem (in `FrontEndTesti`) vs. `window.ethereum` (in main `FrontEnd`):** The `FrontEndTesti` directory shows a more modern and robust Web3 integration approach using `wagmi` and `viem` with `web3modal` to support multiple wallet providers (WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet). The main `FrontEnd/src/context/WalletContext.tsx` uses a more direct `window.ethereum` approach, which is simpler but less flexible for multi-wallet support. This discrepancy should be resolved for consistency.
    *   **Cloudinary:** Integrated for image uploads, demonstrating a practical approach to handling media storage.
2.  **API Design and Implementation:**
    *   **Inferred RESTful API:** The frontend's `AuthContext` and `useMaterial` hooks imply interaction with a backend API (e.g., for user authentication, material persistence beyond local state). The `API_BASE_URL` constant supports this. However, the backend implementation itself is not provided, and the current frontend interactions are mocked.
3.  **Database Interactions:**
    *   No direct database interaction is visible in the provided code. Frontend state is managed locally using React's `useState` and `useReducer` and persisted to `localStorage` for mock authentication and material data. A real backend would require a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for persistent storage.
4.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   **UI Component Structure:** Well-defined, reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal) and feature-specific components (MaterialCard, PriceCalculator).
    *   **State Management:** Effective use of React Context API for global state (`AuthContext`, `WalletContext`, `AppContext`) combined with `useReducer` for more complex state logic.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS usage indicates an intent for responsive design, though full responsiveness across all components cannot be fully assessed without running the application.
    *   **User Experience:** Forms include loading states, error messages, and input adornments (icons), contributing to a better user experience.
5.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Frontend:** `react-query` is used for client-side caching of data, which improves performance by reducing redundant API calls. Vite's `optimizeDeps` is configured to exclude `lucide-react`, which can help with build performance.
    *   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity contracts use `optimizer` settings (`enabled: true`, `runs: 200`) to reduce gas costs and optimize bytecode size.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Complete Backend Implementation:** Develop a robust backend API (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with FastAPI) for user authentication, persistent data storage (materials, branches, logistics), and complex business logic. This is critical for moving beyond mock data and addressing security concerns.
2.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   **Frontend:** Add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests (e.g., using React Testing Library, Jest, Cypress) to ensure UI components, hooks, and user flows function correctly.
    *   **Smart Contracts:** Expand existing tests to cover more edge cases, use fuzzing, and consider formal verification for critical contracts to enhance security and correctness. Aim for higher test coverage.
3.  **Enhance Project Documentation & Hygiene:**
    *   Create a detailed `README.md` with project overview, setup instructions, technology stack, and how to run the application/tests.
    *   Add a `LICENSE` file and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    *   Remove the duplicate `SmartContract/FrontEndTesti` directory and consolidate Web3 integration strategy.
4.  **Implement CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up automated CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions) for both frontend and smart contracts. This would include linting, testing, and deployment steps to ensure code quality and faster, more reliable releases.
5.  **Refine Web3 Integration:** Consolidate the Web3 wallet connection logic, ideally using `wagmi`/`viem` with `web3modal` as seen in `FrontEndTesti`, in the main `FrontEnd` project to provide broader wallet compatibility and a more standardized approach. Connect the frontend's material upload/verification/payment flows to the deployed `RecycleHub` smart contract for real on-chain interaction.
