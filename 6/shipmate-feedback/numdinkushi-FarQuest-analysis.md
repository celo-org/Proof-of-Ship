## Project Summary
-   **Primary purpose/goal**: FarQuest is an immersive blockchain-powered quiz adventure game built on the Celo network, designed to test user knowledge, allow collection of in-game crystals, facilitate leveling up, and provide Celo rewards.
-   **Problem solved**: It aims to provide an engaging Web3 gaming experience that integrates interactive quizzes with blockchain rewards, leveraging the Celo network for transactions and Farcaster for social integration and discovery.
-   **Target users/beneficiaries**: Web3 gamers, blockchain enthusiasts, and users interested in earning crypto rewards through interactive educational content, particularly within the Farcaster ecosystem.

## Technology Stack
-   **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript (primary for frontend/backend logic), JavaScript (for build/deploy scripts), Solidity (for smart contracts), CSS (for styling).
-   **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code**:
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework), Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS), Three.js (3D graphics), Framer Motion (animations), Wagmi (React hooks for Ethereum), Viem (TypeScript interface for Ethereum), Dynamic (Web3 wallet connection), `@farcaster/frame-sdk`, `@farcaster/auth-client`, `@farcaster/frame-node`, `@farcaster/frame-wagmi-connector`, `@neynar/nodejs-sdk`, `@neynar/react`, `@selfxyz/core`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`, Shadcn UI components (Radix UI, `class-variance-authority`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`), `react-toastify`, Sonner (toast notifications).
    *   **Blockchain**: Solidity, Hardhat (development environment), OpenZeppelin Contracts (secure smart contract libraries), Ethers.js (for Hardhat scripts).
    *   **Backend/Database**: Convex (real-time backend with database), Upstash Redis (for KV store, though in-memory fallback is used if not configured).
    *   **Utilities**: `dotenv`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `zod` (schema validation).
-   **Inferred runtime environment(s)**: Node.js (for development, build, and API routes), Browser (for the Next.js frontend), EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain (Celo network for smart contracts).

## Architecture and Structure
-   **Overall project structure observed**: The project follows a typical Next.js application structure, augmented with dedicated directories for smart contracts and Convex backend functions.
    *   `components/`: Reusable React components, including specific game UI elements and general UI components (`ui/`).
    *   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for managing game logic, player stats, game state, questions, and wallet interactions. This promotes strong separation of concerns.
    *   `lib/`: Utility functions, constants, and external service integrations (KV store, Neynar, notifications).
    *   `constants/`: Centralized game constants and question data.
    *   `convex/`: Convex backend functions (queries, mutations) and database schema definition.
    *   `contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts, Hardhat configuration, and deployment scripts.
    *   `public/`: Static assets (images like `icon.png`, `splash.png`).
    *   `pages/` (or `app/` in Next.js 13+): Next.js page routes (`src/app/`).
    *   `scripts/`: Node.js scripts for development, building, and deployment (e.g., Vercel integration).
    *   `src/app/api/`: Next.js API routes for Farcaster authentication, Self Protocol verification, and notifications.
    *   `src/screens/`: Larger, distinct UI sections of the game (menu, complete, rewards).
-   **Key modules/components and their roles**:
    *   `Main.tsx`: The central game component orchestrating all other game UI and logic.
    *   `use-game.tsx`: The primary custom hook (`useGameLogic`) that integrates all other game-related hooks (wallet, game state, player stats, mechanics, questions, Convex).
    *   `convex/queries.ts` & `convex/users.ts`: Define the backend API for user management and game data persistence using Convex.
    *   `contracts/contracts/Farquiz.sol`: The core smart contract handling quiz rewards and NFT minting.
    *   `src/auth.ts`: Configures NextAuth for Farcaster sign-in.
    *   `src/app/api/`: Handles interactions with external services (Neynar, Self Protocol) and Farcaster webhooks.
-   **Code organization assessment**: The code is generally well-organized. The use of custom hooks (e.g., `use-game-state`, `use-player-stats`) effectively encapsulates related logic and state, leading to a modular and maintainable frontend. The separation of Convex functions, smart contracts, and Next.js API routes is clear. Aliases in `components.json` and `tsconfig.json` improve import readability.

## Security Analysis
-   **Authentication & authorization mechanisms**:
    *   **Frontend**: Utilizes `next-auth` with a `CredentialsProvider` for "Sign in with Farcaster", verifying messages via `@farcaster/auth-client`. Session management uses `next-auth` cookies with `httpOnly`, `sameSite: "none"`, and `secure: true` flags, which is appropriate for cross-site authentication on HTTPS.
    *   **Backend (Convex)**: Convex functions (queries/mutations) are exposed publicly. Access control relies on the client passing the `userId` (wallet address) and the Convex function verifying it against the database. There's no explicit server-side authentication of the *caller* of Convex mutations beyond the `userId` in the arguments, which could be a concern if not properly validated on the frontend or if the Convex functions are intended to be called only by authenticated users.
    *   **Smart Contract**: The `QuizRewards` contract uses `Ownable` for `fundContract` and `withdraw` functions, restricting them to the contract owner.
-   **Data validation and sanitization**:
    *   `zod` is used for schema validation in API routes (`notificationDetailsSchema` in `send-notification`).
    *   Convex schema (`convex/schema.ts`) uses `v.string()`, `v.number()`, etc., for basic type validation on database inputs.
    *   Smart contract inputs are typed (e.g., `uint256`, `address`, `string`) and some basic `require` statements are used (e.g., `score <= totalQuestions`).
-   **Potential vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Sensitive Data in Env**: `process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ?? "0x0"` in `contracts/hardhat.config.ts` is a significant security risk. Defaulting a private key to `0x0` means that if `PRIVATE_KEY` is not set, the deployment will attempt to use a zero address, which is insecure and highly problematic for production. This *must* be properly managed (e.g., through a secure CI/CD secret, or a dedicated wallet management system, never committed to repo).
    *   **`CLAIM_SECRET`**: The `CLAIM_SECRET` is read from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAIM_SECRET` in `src/constants/index.ts`. If this is truly `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, it means the secret is exposed on the client-side, which completely undermines its purpose in `claimReward` function where `keccak256(toBytes(CLAIM_SECRET || ''))` is used. This secret should *never* be public. It should be a backend-only secret. This is a critical vulnerability for the reward claiming mechanism.
    *   **Hardcoded `SELF_ENDPOINT`**: `SELF_ENDPOINT` is hardcoded to `https://far-quest.vercel.app/api/self-protocol` in `src/app/api/self-protocol/route.ts` and `src/components/app/self-protocol/self.tsx`. This makes the application less portable and potentially vulnerable if the hardcoded domain is compromised or if the application is deployed to a different domain without updating this. It should be dynamically derived from `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`.
    *   **Convex Public Mutations**: While Convex provides strong guarantees, any mutation that modifies user data (e.g., `updateGameProgress`, `updateQuestionStats`) must ensure that the `userId` argument corresponds to the *authenticated* user making the request. The current structure implies the `userId` is passed from the client, which could be manipulated if not properly secured at the Convex level (which is outside this digest, but a general concern for this pattern).
    *   **Reentrancy**: The `QuizRewards` smart contract uses `ReentrancyGuard` which is a good practice to prevent reentrancy attacks, especially in `completeQuiz` where `transfer` is used.
    *   **Arbitrary `transfer`**: The `withdraw()` function in `QuizRewards` transfers the entire contract balance to the owner. This is standard for `Ownable` contracts but means the owner is a single point of failure.
-   **Secret management approach**:
    *   Environment variables (`.env.local`) are used for secrets like `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`, `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `CLAIM_SECRET`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `NEYNAR_API_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
    *   The `scripts/build.js` and `scripts/deploy.js` handle writing some environment variables (like `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `FRAME_METADATA`) to `.env` and configuring them for Vercel.
    *   As noted, `CLAIM_SECRET` being `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is a major flaw. `PRIVATE_KEY` default should be removed.

## Functionality & Correctness
-   **Core functionalities implemented**:
    *   **Wallet Connection**: Integration with Wagmi and Dynamic for various Web3 wallets, including Farcaster-specific connectors and Coinbase Wallet auto-connect.
    *   **Farcaster Integration**: Sign-in with Farcaster, manifest generation (`.well-known/farcaster.json`), and notification handling.
    *   **Quiz Gameplay**: Interactive question display, answer selection, timer, and feedback (correct/incorrect/time-up).
    *   **Game State Management**: Tracking health, experience, crystals, score, current question, and difficulty progression.
    *   **Blockchain Rewards**: Smart contract (`QuizRewards.sol`) for claiming Celo rewards based on performance and minting NFTs (Quiz Master, High Earner).
    *   **Data Persistence**: Uses Convex for user profiles, game progress, and session tracking.
    *   **User Registration**: On-chain registration via smart contract with a CELO fee.
    *   **Self Protocol Integration**: Optional identity verification for "O.G" status (2x rewards).
-   **Error handling approach**:
    *   Frontend uses `sonner` (toast notifications) for user-friendly error messages (e.g., wallet connection issues, network errors, registration failures).
    *   `try-catch` blocks are used extensively in hooks and API routes to gracefully handle errors from blockchain interactions, API calls, and Convex mutations.
    *   Smart contract uses `require` statements for input validation and state checks.
-   **Edge case handling**:
    *   **Game Over**: Health depletion is handled, transitioning to a 'Game Over' screen and ending the Convex session.
    *   **Time Up**: If the timer runs out, it's treated as an incorrect answer, and health is reduced.
    *   **Network Mismatch**: Prompts the user to switch to the Celo network.
    *   **Existing User/Username**: Convex mutations check for existing users/usernames to prevent duplicates.
    *   **Gas Estimation Failure**: `claimRewards` has a fallback gas limit if `estimateGas` fails, which is a good robustness measure.
-   **Testing strategy**: The provided digest indicates "Missing tests" and "No CI/CD configuration." This is a significant weakness. There are no unit, integration, or end-to-end tests visible in the codebase to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.

## Readability & Understandability
-   **Code style consistency**: The code generally adheres to a consistent style, likely enforced by ESLint (`.eslintrc.json`) and Prettier (though not explicitly shown, common with Next.js projects). TypeScript usage is consistent.
-   **Documentation quality**:
    *   `README.md`: Very comprehensive, detailing features, tech stack, prerequisites, installation, how to play, project structure, key components, game mechanics, deployment, contributing guidelines, troubleshooting, and support. This is a major strength.
    *   Inline comments: Present in key logic areas (e.g., `use-game/index.tsx`, smart contracts, Convex functions) explaining complex parts or intentions.
    *   Type definitions: `src/types/index.ts` clearly defines interfaces for game entities (Question, PlayerStats, GameState, WalletState).
-   **Naming conventions**: Variables, functions, components, and hooks are generally well-named and descriptive (e.g., `useGameLogic`, `PlayerStatsDisplay`, `handleAnswer`).
-   **Complexity management**:
    *   The project effectively manages complexity through modularity, particularly with the extensive use of custom React hooks (`use-wallet`, `use-game-state`, `use-player-stats`, `use-game-mechanics`, `use-question`, `use-user`). This breaks down the overall game logic into manageable, reusable units.
    *   Convex queries and mutations provide a clear API layer for backend interactions, abstracting database operations.
    *   The smart contract is relatively straightforward, using OpenZeppelin for standard patterns, which aids in understanding.

## Dependencies & Setup
-   **Dependencies management approach**: `npm` (or `yarn`) is used for dependency management, with `package.json` listing all required packages for both the main app and the `contracts` sub-project. Dependencies are up-to-date (e.g., Next.js 15, Wagmi 2).
-   **Installation process**: Clearly documented in `README.md`, involving cloning the repo, `cd` into the directory, and `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
-   **Configuration approach**:
    *   Environment variables are managed via `.env.local` for sensitive keys and API endpoints. The `scripts/build.js` and `scripts/deploy.js` automate populating some of these variables and setting them up for Vercel.
    *   `components.json` defines aliases for `shadcn/ui` components.
    *   `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.mjs` configure styling.
    *   `next.config.ts` is present but empty, implying default Next.js configuration.
    *   `hardhat.config.ts` configures the Hardhat environment for smart contract compilation and deployment to Celo networks (Alfajores testnet and mainnet).
-   **Deployment considerations**:
    *   Frontend deployment is targeted for Vercel, with `vercel.json` and dedicated `scripts/deploy.js` for automation, including setting environment variables and handling Farcaster manifest generation.
    *   Convex backend deployment uses `npx convex deploy`.
    *   Smart contract deployment uses `npx hardhat deploy --network celo`.
    *   The deployment scripts are quite sophisticated, handling domain validation, Neynar API key integration, Farcaster manifest signing, and Vercel CLI interactions, including auto-login and environment variable setup.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration**:
    *   **Next.js & React**: Strong usage with `app` directory, API routes, `dynamic` imports for SSR control (e.g., `Main` component, `WagmiProvider`), and server components (`RootLayout`).
    *   **Wagmi & Viem**: Used effectively for wallet connection, chain switching, and blockchain interactions (`useAccount`, `useConnect`, `useDisconnect`, `useSwitchChain`, `usePublicClient`, `useSendTransaction`). The `useWallet` hook encapsulates much of this logic, making it reusable.
    *   **Convex**: Well-integrated as a real-time backend. Schema definition, queries (`getUserByAddress`, `getLeaderboard`), and mutations (`createUser`, `updateGameProgress`) are clearly structured and used.
    *   **Hardhat & OpenZeppelin**: Standard and secure practices for smart contract development. `ReentrancyGuard` is a good example.
    *   **Three.js & Framer Motion**: Used for immersive 3D animations (`ThreeJSBackground`) and smooth UI transitions/effects (`motion.div`, `AnimatePresence`). This adds a professional and engaging feel to the UI.
    *   **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling, ensuring responsive and visually appealing design. Shadcn UI components further leverage Tailwind.
    *   **Farcaster SDK**: Integrated for sign-in (`auth.ts`), frame metadata (`getFarcasterMetadata`), and notifications (`send-notification`, `webhook`).
    *   **Self Protocol**: Integration for identity verification, demonstrating advanced Web3 user flows.
2.  **API Design and Implementation**:
    *   **Next.js API Routes**: Used for server-side logic that requires API keys or external service interactions (e.g., Neynar API for Farcaster user data, Self Protocol verification, sending notifications). This isolates sensitive operations from the client.
    *   **Convex API**: The `convex/queries.ts` and `convex/users.ts` files define a clear API for the frontend to interact with the database, abstracting away direct database calls.
3.  **Database Interactions**:
    *   **Convex**: Data model (`schema.ts`) is well-defined with appropriate indexes (`by_address`, `by_score`, `by_level`, `by_username`, `by_user`, `by_start_time`). Queries and mutations are implemented to fetch and update user and game session data efficiently. `console.log` statements within Convex functions indicate a focus on debugging and understanding data flow.
    *   **Upstash Redis**: Used as a KV store for notification details, providing a scalable solution for Farcaster notifications. The in-memory fallback is a practical approach for local development.
4.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   **UI Component Structure**: Components are logically separated (e.g., `GameHeader`, `GameContent`, `PlayerStatsDisplay`, `QuestionDisplay`). `src/screens` for larger views is a good pattern.
    *   **State Management**: Complex game state is managed effectively using a combination of `useState` and custom hooks (`useGameState`, `usePlayerStats`, `useGameMechanics`, `useQuestionManager`, `useUserManagement`). The `useGameLogic` hook acts as a central orchestrator.
    *   **Responsive Design**: Implied by the use of Tailwind CSS, though specific responsive breakpoints are not detailed in the provided digest.
    *   **Accessibility considerations**: Some basic `aria-label` attributes are used for buttons.
5.  **Performance Optimization**:
    *   **Dynamic Imports**: `next/dynamic` is used for components that interact with the Farcaster Frame SDK (`Main`, `WagmiProvider`), preventing them from being rendered on the server if not needed, which can improve initial load times.
    *   **Blockchain Interactions**: Gas estimation and setting `maxFeePerGas`/`maxPriorityFeePerGas` in `claimRewards` indicate an awareness of blockchain transaction costs and performance.
    *   **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header mentioned in `README.md` for Farcaster Mini App embeds suggests awareness of feed caching. No explicit client-side caching strategies beyond default React/Next.js behavior are visible for game data, but Convex often handles real-time updates efficiently.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Address Security Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Critical**: Immediately change `CLAIM_SECRET` to be a server-side only environment variable (remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). The `claimReward` function should be called from a secure backend API route, not directly from the client with a client-exposed secret.
    *   **High**: Remove `?? "0x0"` fallback for `PRIVATE_KEY` in `hardhat.config.ts` and ensure `PRIVATE_KEY` is always securely provided (e.g., via CI/CD secrets or a dedicated key management service) for contract deployments.
    *   **Medium**: Make `SELF_ENDPOINT` dynamic based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` to ensure portability and avoid issues if deployed to a custom domain.
    *   **General**: Conduct a thorough security audit, especially for smart contracts and API routes that interact with sensitive user data or funds.
2.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing**: Develop unit tests for critical logic (game mechanics, utility functions, Convex mutations/queries), integration tests for API routes and smart contract interactions, and end-to-end tests for the full game flow. This is crucial for ensuring correctness and preventing regressions, especially given the financial aspects (Celo rewards).
3.  **Enhance User Experience & Onboarding**:
    *   Provide clearer feedback during blockchain transactions (e.g., "Transaction pending...", "Confirm in wallet").
    *   Consider adding a loading spinner or skeleton UI for data fetching from Convex or blockchain, especially on initial load or during state transitions.
    *   Improve the user registration flow by allowing username input *before* the on-chain registration, or explaining the fee more prominently.
4.  **Improve Community and Documentation**:
    *   Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with clear guidelines for new contributors.
    *   Create a `docs/` directory for more in-depth technical documentation beyond the `README`, especially for custom hooks, Convex schema, and smart contract details.
    *   Consider adding a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to foster a welcoming community.
5.  **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Vercel's built-in CI, or other platforms) to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. This will significantly improve development efficiency and code quality.

**Potential Future Development Directions**:
*   **Leaderboards and Achievements**: Expand on the existing leaderboard queries to display more detailed user stats and potentially introduce more in-game achievements tied to NFTs or special rewards.
*   **Dynamic Question Generation/Management**: Instead of a static `QUESTIONS` array, implement a system to fetch questions from a backend API or a decentralized source, allowing for easier updates and expansion of content.
*   **In-Game Customization/NFTs**: Allow players to customize their in-game avatars or acquire cosmetic NFTs, potentially integrating with Farcaster Profile pictures or other NFT standards.
*   **Multiplayer/Social Features**: Explore adding social elements like challenging friends, private leaderboards, or collaborative quiz modes, leveraging Farcaster's social graph.
*   **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate more robust analytics to track user engagement, question performance, and reward distribution.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: While Tailwind is used, a dedicated review of the UI on various mobile devices would ensure optimal experience.
