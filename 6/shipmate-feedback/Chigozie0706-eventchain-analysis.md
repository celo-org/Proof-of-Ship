## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal**: EventChain aims to be a decentralized ticketing platform leveraging the Celo blockchain.
- **Problem solved**: It addresses issues common in traditional ticketing systems such as lack of transparency, potential for fraud, and high fees by decentralizing the process. It also integrates innovative social good features like Universal Basic Income (UBI) donations and referral incentives.
- **Target users/beneficiaries**: Event organizers (to create and manage events), ticket buyers (to purchase tickets securely and transparently, with refund options), and potentially beneficiaries of UBI and participants in the referral economy.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified**: TypeScript, Solidity, JavaScript, CSS.
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code**:
    - **Smart Contracts (Backend)**: Hardhat (for development, testing, deployment), OpenZeppelin Contracts (for secure, reusable smart contract components), Ethers.js (for testing utilities).
    - **Frontend**: Next.js (for React-based web application development, utilizing App Router), Wagmi (React Hooks for Ethereum), RainbowKit (wallet connection UI), Viem (lightweight Ethereum client), Tailwind CSS (for styling), Axios (HTTP client), @pinata/sdk (for IPFS interactions), @divvi/referral-sdk (for referral tracking), @selfxyz/core & @selfxyz/qrcode (for identity verification).
- **Inferred runtime environment(s)**: Node.js (for both frontend and backend development/execution), Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the Celo blockchain (for smart contract execution).

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed**: The project follows a clear monorepo-like structure, divided into two main directories: `backend/` and `event-frontend/`. This separation effectively isolates the smart contract logic from the web application.
- **Key modules/components and their roles**:
    - `backend/`: Contains all Solidity smart contracts (`EventChain.sol`, `TicketNFT.sol` mentioned in README but not in digest, `MockERC20.sol`), Hardhat configuration (`hardhat.config.js`), deployment scripts (`ignition/modules/EventChain.js`), and unit tests (`test/EventChain.test.js`). This module handles all on-chain logic.
    - `event-frontend/`: A Next.js application that serves as the user interface. It is organized using the App Router, with distinct pages for event creation, viewing, and ticket management. It includes reusable React components (`components/`), context for Web3 interactions (`context/ContractContext.tsx`), and local API routes (`app/api/`) for specific server-side operations (e.g., Self Protocol verification, image proxy).
- **Code organization assessment**: The code organization is logical and follows common best practices for both Solidity and Next.js projects. The clear separation of concerns, modular components, and dedicated directories contribute to good maintainability and understandability.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms**:
    - **Authentication**: Users authenticate by connecting their Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask via RainbowKit/Wagmi). This is standard for DApps.
    - **Authorization**: The `EventChain.sol` smart contract uses an `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict critical functions like `cancelEvent` and `releaseFunds` to the event creator. This is a good practice for access control.
- **Data validation and sanitization**:
    - **Smart Contract**: Robust input validation is implemented directly in the `createEvent` function using `require` statements (e.g., `MAX_NAME_LENGTH`, `_startDate >= block.timestamp`, `_ticketPrice > 0`). This is crucial for on-chain integrity.
    - **Frontend**: Client-side validation is present in `EventForm.tsx` to provide immediate user feedback, complementing the smart contract's validation.
- **Potential vulnerabilities**:
    - **Critical: Exposed Pinata JWT**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT` environment variable is directly accessed in `ImageUploader.tsx` and `EventForm.tsx` within the frontend, implying it's exposed client-side. This is a severe security vulnerability as an attacker could extract this JWT and abuse the Pinata account, leading to unauthorized uploads, deletions, or data manipulation on IPFS. **This must be fixed immediately by moving the IPFS upload logic to a secure backend API route.**
    - **DoS in View Functions**: While `MAX_ATTENDEES` limits attendees per event, the `getAllEvents`, `getUserEvents`, and `getActiveEventsByCreator` view functions in `EventChain.sol` iterate over the entire `events` array. If the total number of events grows very large, these functions could become extremely gas-intensive (even for view calls, which don't cost the caller gas but consume node resources) or exceed block gas limits if they were state-changing. This is a scalability concern.
    - **Hardcoded Contract Addresses**: The `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is hardcoded in multiple frontend files. While common in DApps, it requires manual updates if the smart contract needs to be redeployed to a new address.
    - **Self Protocol Endpoint**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT` (e.g., Ngrok URL) is public. While expected for Self Protocol, ensuring the endpoint itself is secured and only handles expected traffic is important.
- **Secret management approach**: `.env` files are used for managing environment variables (e.g., `PRIVATE_KEY` for backend, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT` for frontend). The critical issue is the public exposure of `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT`. The `PRIVATE_KEY` for deployment is correctly kept server-side.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented**:
    - **Event Creation**: Users can create events with details like name, image, description, dates, times, location, price, minimum age, and payment token.
    - **Ticket Purchasing**: Users can buy tickets using various Celo stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL) and GoodDollar (G$) tokens, with a 1% automatic donation to the UBI pool for G$ purchases.
    - **Refunds**: Users can request refunds for canceled events or before a specified `REFUND_BUFFER` (5 hours) prior to the event start.
    - **Referral Tracking**: Integration with Divvi SDK to track referrals for event creation, purchase, and refunds.
    - **Identity/Age Verification**: Self Protocol integration for age-based ticket filtering and other identity checks.
    - **IPFS Image Uploads**: Event banners are uploaded to IPFS.
- **Error handling approach**:
    - **Smart Contract**: Uses `require` statements for precondition checks, reverting transactions with descriptive messages on failure.
    - **Frontend**: Employs `react-hot-toast` for user-friendly notifications (loading, success, error messages) and `console.error` for detailed logging of issues. `try-catch` blocks are used extensively for asynchronous operations.
- **Edge case handling**:
    - **Refunds**: Logic correctly differentiates between refunds for canceled events and pre-event refunds (within the buffer).
    - **Event Capacity**: `MAX_ATTENDEES` constant limits ticket sales per event.
    - **Token Payments**: Special handling for G$ `transferAndCall` vs. standard ERC20 `approve`/`transferFrom` is implemented.
    - **Image Upload Fallback**: Frontend uses a default image if the event image URL fails to load.
- **Testing strategy**:
    - **Backend (Smart Contracts)**: Unit tests are present in `backend/test/EventChain.test.js` using Hardhat, Chai, and Ethers.js. These tests cover core functionalities like event creation, ticket buying, refunds, and fund release, indicating a foundational level of correctness.
    - **Frontend**: No explicit frontend tests (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) are visible in the digest. The `eslint.config.mjs` has `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` for ESLint, which is a significant red flag for code quality and correctness assurance in production builds.
    - **Missing Features**: The `deleteEventById` function is referenced in `CreatorEventCard.tsx` but is not part of the `EventChain.sol` ABI or implementation. This suggests an incomplete feature.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency**: The code generally adheres to consistent styling conventions for both TypeScript/JavaScript (camelCase, clear function definitions) and Solidity (PascalCase for contracts/structs, snake_case for constants, NatSpec comments).
- **Documentation quality**:
    - **READMEs**: Both the root `README.md` and `backend/README.md` are comprehensive, providing excellent overviews of features, user flow, smart contract details, and setup instructions.
    - **In-code comments**: Solidity contracts utilize NatSpec comments for functions, parameters, and return values, enhancing understanding. Frontend code also includes comments, though less extensive.
- **Naming conventions**: Naming is generally clear and consistent across the project (e.g., `eventName`, `ticketPrice`, `EventChain`, `buyTicket`).
- **Complexity management**: The project manages complexity well by separating the concerns into backend (Solidity) and frontend (Next.js). Within each, modular components and clear function definitions help keep individual parts manageable. The use of Wagmi hooks abstracts away much of the raw Web3 interaction complexity.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach**: Dependencies are managed using `package.json` files in both `backend/` and `event-frontend/`. `pnpm` is explicitly mentioned for frontend installation, implying its use. OpenZeppelin Contracts are correctly used as a dependency for the Solidity project.
- **Installation process**: Detailed and clear step-by-step instructions are provided in the `README.md` files for compiling and deploying the smart contracts, and for starting the frontend development server. Prerequisites are also listed.
- **Configuration approach**: Environment variables are used via `dotenv` for sensitive information like private keys and API keys, which is a standard practice. Network configurations for Hardhat are well-defined.
- **Deployment considerations**: Instructions for deploying smart contracts using Hardhat Ignition to Celo testnet/mainnet are provided. The frontend mentions deployment on Vercel. The lack of CI/CD means deployments are manual, which can be error-prone.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration**:
    - **Wagmi/RainbowKit/Viem**: Excellent and correct integration for wallet connection, blockchain interaction (reading contract state, sending transactions), and transaction status tracking. This demonstrates proficiency in modern Web3 frontend development.
    - **Hardhat/Ignition**: Properly used for smart contract development lifecycle (compilation, deployment, testing), showing adherence to industry standards for Solidity projects.
    - **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Correctly imported and utilized for common patterns (e.g., `ReentrancyGuard`, `IERC20`), showcasing awareness of secure and efficient contract development.
    - **Divvi SDK & Self Protocol**: Integration of these specialized Web3 SDKs (for referral tracking and identity verification, respectively) is a strong indicator of advanced DApp capabilities and a willingness to incorporate complex features.
    - **Next.js App Router**: The use of the latest Next.js features demonstrates modern frontend development practices.
2.  **API Design and Implementation**:
    - **Smart Contract API**: The `EventChain.sol` contract exposes a well-defined API with clear functions for event lifecycle management and data retrieval.
    - **Frontend API Routes**: Simple API routes (`getAddress.tsx`, `events/[eventId]/verify/route.tsx`, `proxy-image/route.js`) are used, demonstrating an understanding of how to bridge client-side and server-side logic in a Next.js application. The image proxy is a good pattern for handling potential CORS issues with IPFS gateways.
3.  **Database Interactions**:
    - For this project, the Celo blockchain serves as the primary data store. The smart contract's `Event` struct and mappings (`events`, `eventAttendees`, `creatorEvents`, `hasPurchasedTicket`) represent the data model.
    - **Query Optimization**: The view functions `getAllEvents`, `getUserEvents`, `getActiveEventsByCreator` iterate over the `events` array. While functional, this pattern can become inefficient and gas-intensive for large numbers of events, which is a known scalability challenge for on-chain data retrieval.
4.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    - **UI Component Structure**: The project uses a modular component-based architecture (`EventCard`, `EventForm`, `Navbar`, etc.), promoting reusability and maintainability.
    - **State Management**: React's `useState` and Wagmi hooks are effectively used for managing UI and blockchain-related state.
    - **Responsive Design**: The use of Tailwind CSS implies a responsive design approach, though responsiveness itself was not directly assessed from the digest.
5.  **Performance Optimization**:
    - **Smart Contract**: The Hardhat configuration enables the Solidity optimizer and `viaIR`, which are good practices for contract efficiency. `nonReentrant` guards help prevent reentrancy attacks, indirectly contributing to security and predictable execution.
    - **Frontend**: Wagmi's integration with `@tanstack/react-query` provides caching for contract reads, improving perceived performance. The image proxy can help optimize image loading. However, the `eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }` setting in `next.config.ts` is a bad practice that can mask performance issues or bugs during builds.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Address Critical Security Vulnerability**: **Immediately move the Pinata JWT usage to a secure, server-side-only API route.** Exposing this key client-side is a critical security flaw. The frontend should call this new backend API route, which then securely interacts with Pinata.
2.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing and CI/CD**: Expand smart contract test coverage (e.g., using Hardhat Coverage). Add frontend tests (unit, integration) using tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Integrate a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and rapid, reliable releases.
3.  **Improve Smart Contract Scalability for Data Retrieval**: For functions that iterate over potentially large arrays of events (`getAllEvents`, `getUserEvents`, `getActiveEventsByCreator`), consider alternative patterns like pagination or off-chain indexing solutions (e.g., The Graph, Covalent) if the number of events is expected to scale significantly, to avoid high gas costs or transaction failures for users.
4.  **Enhance Project Maturity**:
    *   Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with detailed guidelines for external contributions.
    *   Ensure the license information is consistently and clearly stated in all necessary files (e.g., `LICENSE` file).
    *   Remove `eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }` from `next.config.ts` and resolve any ESLint errors to ensure higher code quality.
5.  **Refine Incomplete Features**: Either fully implement the `deleteEventById` functionality in the smart contract and frontend, or remove the dead code to avoid confusion and maintain a clean codebase.
