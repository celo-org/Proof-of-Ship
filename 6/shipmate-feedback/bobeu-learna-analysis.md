## Error

Error: Code digest not provided.

I apologize, but I cannot perform the requested analysis as the "code digest" (the code or repository content) was not provided. The message "Error fetching repository: Repository not found. Make sure it is public or that you have provided a valid token." indicates that the system was unable to retrieve the code for analysis.

Please provide the code digest (e.g., relevant code snippets, file structure, or a description of the project's technical aspects) so I can proceed with the assessment.
