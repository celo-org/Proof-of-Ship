## Error

Error: Code digest not provided.

As an expert software architect and code reviewer, I require the actual code digest to perform the analysis. The message "Error fetching repository: Repository not found. Make sure it is public or that you have provided a valid token." indicates that the necessary input (the code digest) was not supplied.

Therefore, I cannot generate a comprehensive assessment, scores, or detailed analysis for the project. Please provide the code digest or ensure the repository is accessible.

**Unable to perform analysis without code digest.**
