##  Hey Builders,

First off, amazing work on your PoS submissions — every project, whether early-stage or more advanced, brings us a lot of joy to review. Just a few quick reminders and encouragements to help you keep leveling up:

### 🔄 General Completeness of Submission
- **Update your video** every time you add new functionality — this isn't just for the judges, it's great training for yourself. Show off your progress. In the future only newly updated videos will receive points. The goal is for you to iterate and improve as well as share your updates. 
- **Update your deck** to match your latest build and clarify your narrative. A good story makes your tech more powerful. A good founder works constantly on improving their deck!! In the future only newly updated decks will receive points. The goal is for you to iterate and improve  as well as share your updates. 
- **Update your README** to match the information on KarmaGAP. This will be used by the agent to compare the techincal implementations and you want it to be up to date to get the best score possible. Discrepancies between README and technical implementation lead to loss of points. 
- Make sure **smart contracts and repositories are correctly connected** to KarmaGAP. This is the data we are using to evaluate your project. If it's not connected, it won't count into your score!

### Presentation IRL and in the video

Please remember that your presentation is the most important thing of your project. This is what people see. So, please follow the guide provided

- Time distribution
  - **1 min** intro to the idea, please use a deck or graphics or something visually pleasing. People have a short attention span and when you just talk over the startscreen of your dap, you loose them. Add highlights of the updates of the month
  - **2 min** walkthrough. Please pre-record and don't do a live demo. Add a voice over, but please with your own voice and not with AI. 
  - **1 min** roadmap, team, challenges, architecture. Create a personal relationship to the viewer.
- Practice your live presentation. Imagine the founders of Celo are watching this and probably a VC. Make sure you stand out. 
- Make sure your tech works. Invest in a better mic and check your recording afterwards for quality. In the end your online communication counts a lot and if people don't understand you, they won't be able to see your fill potential. 
- DONTS
  - If you are using AI generated slides, please make sure to check them. I saw so many references to tech that was not in fact used. Don't overload your presentation with AI generated content, it will be too much. 
  - Please make sure you don't have too much text on the slides. You will loose the judge and not manage to fully present your idea.
  - Do NOT only use music and subtitles. Please speak over the video. If you are not good in speaking, practice. 

### 🤖 On Using AI
- If you're using AI tools (for slides, docs, UI, etc.), that's awesome — just **review the output**. It's your vision; make sure the tech reflects it.
- **Less is more.** Focusing on **one or two core features and making them work beautifully** is more impressive than shipping a broken UI full of potential. Quality > vibe-coded quantity. DON'T clutter you dapp with pages and functionalities that don't work. 
- AI designed components are very boring and whole apps, have too many elements, too much text and no soul. It's hard to make clear, that you are serious about your dapp when you work with an AI template. Make sure to personalize it. 

Now, onto your personalized feedback. Each note below is tailored to your project, with love and belief in your potential. Let's build.


## 3 Wheeler Bike Club

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/3-wheeler-bike-club)

**Feedback:**
- Amazing progress since the last time.
- No navigation after the KYC process.
- Add a message, like you can go back to the homepage and we will notify you once you have been approved.
- But why does it take time to get reviewed when you already created the proof with Self? Huge improvement to the UI and UX.
- Buttons on the Dashboard, membership page for drivers should be rounded and not square.
- Also all containers should be slightly rounded.
- Membership page still looks very hacked.
- I would suggest creating a component library that you can reuse in all apps.
- Is the union feature live? Otherwise, remove or add a note, coming soon.
- A little flag maybe.

[View on KarmaGAP](AfriCycle | Karma GAP)

**Feedback:**
- Great progress, looking forward to seeing you onboarding more users.

## Bank Of Celo

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/bank-of-celo)

**Feedback:**
- Not clear when the jackpot will be distributed.
- Is there a min amount of participants? And can you add more share functionalities, so people can share the jackpot and promote it.
- After I checked in, the check-in button should be disabled.
- Please consider working with a designer, to make it look less like AI and more like a fun app to use.

## Buy Hypercerts on Celo

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/buy-hypercerts-on-celo)

**Feedback:**

- Add links for people to understand hypercerts.
- The Celo logo used is the old one, please check for Celo Brand Kit to get the up-to-date logos (might be an issue with hypercerts).
- Tested some detail pages, and couldn't find a hypercert that was available to buy.
- The info should be available on the main page, e.g., a sold out banner or the card should be disabled etc.
- Very AI design.
- Please consider giving your project some style guidelines.

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/canvassing)

- Clear integration of AI and Web
- Automated and fair incentives.
- Focus on quality, not quantity.


---

## EduCert - Certificate Verification

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/educert---certificate-verification)

- Add text to the demo video, otherwise it's hard to follow.
- Please add personalized style/logo/colors to the website.
- A learning website should be designed to keep your attention.
- I like that you create a framework for people to offer courses etc.

- Is this a training project or do you want to go live with it? If yes, improve the design.

---

## Expendi

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/expendi)

**Feedback:**
- New project.

- There are no milestones accomplished, no Txns, but seems to have some commits.
- Website is not working.
- Cannot find really the utility of the project.


---

## Faucet Drops

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/faucet-drops)

**Feedback:**
- UI looks much cleaner.
- After creating a faucet drop, I am redirected to the detail page, but also logged out.
- I should be able to add an amount and a droplist to the drop, when I create it.
- If that is not possible, that should be visible actions for me to take on the drop.
- Okay.
- I found the admin controls, they are below the faucet.
- Took me some time.
- Improve UX, so admin control is easy to find and use.
- How are you verifying X and Telegram names?

---

## Learna

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/learna)

**Feedback:**
- When building a learning platform, the user flow is not the most important thing, it's how and if you provide high quality content.
- AI is a great progress and chance for learning platforms, if you use it.
- Creating your own content can lead to a lot of overhead and low ROI.
- Consider creating more of a marketplace.
- Or understand how to successfully scrape relevant content from docs of chains etc.
- I like that you personalized the app with a font, but the colors still have the AI created frontend vibe.
- Maybe add some of your own colors/style to it.
- Who are your users? Is this only web3 devs, what is your market size? Who are your competitors? How do you differ from MetaSchool or something similar?


---

## Minilend by Pesabits

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/minilend-by-pesabits)

**Feedback:**
- After you save money, would be nice to see a UX at the top saying how much money you saved and your returns so far.
- Lots of potential here.
- Would be nice to see more users testing it and getting more user feedback.
- Explain how liquidations work etc. - Liquidations: We leverage on mento oracle prices and if your collateral drops below 150% of your loan, it is liquidation eligible. During a liquidation, the protocol will only seize enough collateral as principal plus accrued interest and 5% (to treasury) and repay debt (including unwinding Aave positions for dollar‑backed assets) and return any remainder to you.
- seems buggy. 
- overall great idea! 


---

## Mobarter

**Feedback:**
- Add GitHub repo to the project description as well.
- Make the vault option more prominent, hard to find when you have to scroll down.
- How it works is moved to the bottom in the mobile view.
- After depositing, the TVL amount for the Vault just had the status "Loading..." but didn't update.
- cool idea with vaults. Can the user swap into other assets automatically to chase higher yielding opps. 
- not sure the need for an NFT.
