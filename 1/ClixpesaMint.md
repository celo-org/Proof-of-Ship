## Goal for this Proof of Ship
### Clixpesa smart contracts redesign, upgrades and overdraft feature.

With a successfull run of the MVP we plan to carry out smart contracts redesign, improvements and also add an overdraft feature. 
- **ROSCAs / Clixpesa Spaces contracts improvements**: 
Clixpesa spaces is Clixpesa's saving products for both groups and individuals. The groups can be both 
informal groups and ROSCAs. In our MVP these groups exist as individual multi-sig contracts deployed on 
Celo whenever a user creates a space. While this gave users ultimate control on their spaces, it has been a 
nightmare to manage especially whenever we need to upgrade their functionality. For this reason we seek 
to change this to a singleton-style architecture where all spaces/groups are managed in a single contract.

- **Overdraft Facility / Clixpesa Jazisha**:
Clixpesa has managed to test out its peer to peer lending product within the chamas. The average loan 
amounts to every individual are about $70. Users repay these loans in a very short time and again request to 
continue with another purchase. This forms a very good basis to have a product in our wallet that can allow 
users to overdraw their wallet for amounts up to $100. Users can be charged a lower interest for this than a 
normal loan and therefore increase the volume of spend among our users.

- **Clipesa x Partner Protocols**:
Clixpesa contracts have since existed as silos in the ecosystem, we seek to integrate partner protocols to our new
contracts to add yield to savings and also connect to liquidity pools in the ecosystem
