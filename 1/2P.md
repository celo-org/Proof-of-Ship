Project Name - "2P"

GOAL:
-TDevelop a decentralized, fair, and transparent two-player staking game where both players stake an entry amount, and the winner takes all while the platform deducts a 5% playing fee.

Detailed Description
-This project is a blockchain-based two-player staking game where:

1. Two players compete by staking a predetermined amount by staking a predetermined amount.

2. The game logic determines a winner based on predefined rules.

3. The winner receives 95% of the total pot, and the platform takes a 5% fee.

4. The game operates in a decentralized manner using smart contracts to ensure fairness and transparency.

5. Unlike traditional online games where players often compete against AI-controlled opponents, this game is all about playing against real people—your friends! This makes it more fun, competitive, and engaging.

Right now, we have a simple memory card game, but in the future, we can extend this platform to various types of games, making it even more exciting.

PROBLEM:
- Trust Issues in Online Games: Many staking games require players to trust a central authority to handle funds, leading to fraud risks.

- Lack of Transparency: Traditional online betting games often lack transparency in determining winners.

- High Transaction Fees: Centralized gaming platforms charge high commission fees, reducing player rewards.

- Slow Payment Processing: Many gaming platforms take time to process winnings, leading to withdrawal delays.

SOLUTION:
- Blockchain Smart Contracts: Ensure trustless and secure fund handling.

- Transparent & Automated Execution: The game logic, winner selection, and payouts are managed through immutable smart contracts.

- Lower Fees: With only a 5% fee, players retain a larger share of the winnings compared to centralized platforms.

- Instant Payouts: Smart contracts ensure immediate fund transfers to the winner’s wallet, reducing waiting times., eliminating withdrawal delays.

Future Scope
- Multi-Player Mode: Expand the game to allow more than two players in staking matches.

- NFT Integration: Introduce NFTs as entry tickets, rewards, or unique game boosts.

- Leaderboards & Tournaments: Reward top players with exclusive incentives.
