-   **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code**:
    *   **Frontend**: React, Next.js (v15.0.3), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Embla Carousel, Motion/React.
    *   **Web3/Blockchain**: Wagmi (v2.14.12), Viem (v2.37.2), `@farcaster/frame-sdk`, `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk`, `@farcaster/auth-client`, `@farcaster/auth-kit`, `@noble/ed25519` (for Farcaster auth token signing), Thirdweb (for smart contract interactions), `@divvi/referral-sdk`.
    *   **Backend/Database**: Mongoose (v8.17.1), MongoDB Atlas, NextAuth (v4.24.11).
    *   **Utilities/Dev Tools**: `dotenv`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `zod`, `tsx`, `localtunnel`, `inquirer`, `pino-pretty`.
-   **Inferred runtime environment(s)**: Node.js (for Next.js backend/API routes and scripts), Browser (for React frontend). Deployment target is Vercel.

## Architecture and Structure
-   **Overall project structure observed**: The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure.
    *   `src/app`: Contains main pages (`page.tsx`), API routes (`api`), and layouts (`layout.tsx`).
    *   `src/components`: Houses reusable UI components (e.g., `MovieCard`, `Header`, `SearchBar`, Shadcn UI components).
    *   `src/lib`: Contains core logic and utility functions for database interactions (`mongo.ts`), external API clients (`farcaster.ts`, `tmdb.ts`), constants, and general utilities.
    *   `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks (`onboarding.ts`).
    *   `src/constants`: Defines blockchain-related constants like contract address and ABI.
    *   `src/data`: Static JSON data for trailers and onboarding movies.
    *   `scripts`: Contains custom build and deployment scripts.
-   **Key modules/components and their roles**:
    *   **API Routes (`src/app/api`)**: Handle data fetching and manipulation for movies, votes, comments, watchlist, leaderboards, user points, TMDB imports, Thirdweb integrations, Farcaster webhooks, and various testing/debugging endpoints.
    *   **Frontend Pages (`src/app`)**: Implement the user-facing interface for movie discovery, voting, rewards, leaderboards, watchlist, and an admin dashboard.
    *   **Database Layer (`src/lib/mongo.ts`)**: Manages MongoDB connections and defines Mongoose schemas for `Movie`, `Vote`, `Notification`, `Watchlist`, `Comment`, and `Points`. Provides CRUD operations and aggregation logic.
    *   **Web3 Integration (`src/components/providers/WagmiProvider.tsx`, `src/lib/farcaster.ts`)**: Sets up Wagmi for wallet connections and Celo blockchain interactions. `farcaster.ts` provides a native Farcaster API client.
    *   **UI Components (`src/components`)**: Provide a consistent and interactive user interface, leveraging Shadcn UI and custom components.
-   **Code organization assessment**: The project is generally well-organized for a Next.js application. Separation of concerns is evident between UI components, API logic, and utility functions. The use of `src/lib` for core logic is effective. However, the `src/app/providers.tsx` vs `src/components/providers/Providers.tsx` and `ConditionalLayout` structure is slightly redundant and could be streamlined.

## Security Analysis
-   **Authentication & authorization mechanisms**:
    *   Uses `next-auth` with a Farcaster CredentialsProvider for user authentication, verifying Farcaster sign-in messages.
    *   User sessions store the Farcaster ID (FID).
    *   **Critical Flaw**: The admin page (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`) has no explicit authentication or authorization. Anyone can access it to add/retract movies, import from TMDB, trigger Thirdweb contract calls, or reset content IDs.
-   **Data validation and sanitization**:
    *   `zod` is used for schema validation in `src/app/api/send-notification/route.ts`.
    *   The comments API (`src/app/api/comments/route.ts`) includes length checks for comment and reply content.
    *   However, many API routes (e.g., `/api/movies`, `/api/tv`, `/api/watchlist`, `/api/vote`) appear to directly use user-provided `movieId`, `userAddress`, `type` without comprehensive server-side validation or sanitization, opening potential avenues for abuse or data integrity issues.
-   **Potential vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Critical Farcaster Private Key Exposure**: `FARCASTER_SETUP.md` explicitly warns that `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` is exposed in the browser. This is a severe vulnerability, as an attacker could steal the private key and impersonate the Farcaster account. The `scripts/build.js` and `scripts/deploy.js` also handle seed phrases and private keys, which must be managed with extreme care to prevent accidental exposure.
    *   **Unauthenticated Admin Panel**: As mentioned, the admin dashboard is publicly accessible, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate core application data and initiate blockchain transactions.
    *   **Inconsistent Input Validation**: Lack of consistent and robust server-side input validation across all API endpoints could lead to various issues, including malformed data, denial-of-service, or even more sophisticated attacks if not handled carefully.
    *   **Secret Management in `mcp.server.json`**: The `mcp.server.json` file contains a hardcoded MongoDB connection string with credentials. While it might be for a read-only local instance, storing credentials directly in a configuration file (especially if committed to source control) is a bad practice.
-   **Secret management approach**: Environment variables (`.env.local`) are used for sensitive information like `MONGODB_URI`, `TMDB_API_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and Farcaster keys. The Vercel deployment script attempts to manage these during deployment. The critical issue is the client-side exposure of the Farcaster private key via `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

## Functionality & Correctness
-   **Core functionalities implemented**:
    *   **Movie/TV Show Discovery**: Users can browse recently added and trending movies/TV shows, with a search bar for filtering.
    *   **Voting**: Users can vote "Yes" or "No" on movies, with votes being recorded both on-chain (Celo) and in MongoDB.
    *   **Rewards System**: Users earn points for voting and commenting, with a dedicated page to view points and potential rewards/badges.
    *   **Watchlist**: Users can add/remove movies to a personal watchlist.
    *   **Comments & Replies**: Users can post comments and replies on movie detail pages, and like comments. Latest comments are shown on the home page.
    *   **Leaderboards**: Displays top voters, longest streaks, and top earners based on user activity.
    *   **Admin Panel**: Provides tools for adding content manually, importing from TMDB (trending movies/TV shows, search), retracting recent imports, syncing content to the smart contract, and fixing poster URLs.
    *   **Farcaster Integration**: Mini App SDK integration, Farcaster sign-in, user profile lookup, and channel APIs are implemented.
    *   **Onboarding**: An interactive onboarding screen guides new users.
-   **Error handling approach**:
    *   Frontend handles Wagmi/Viem transaction errors (e.g., "Insufficient CELO for gas fees", "Transaction was cancelled", "Smart contract execution failed") with `alert()` messages.
    *   API routes use `try-catch` blocks and return `NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: ... })` with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 500).
    *   Specific error messages are provided for scenarios like "You have already voted on this movie."
-   **Edge case handling**:
    *   UI gracefully handles empty states (no movies, no comments, empty watchlist).
    *   Checks for insufficient CELO balance before initiating blockchain transactions.
    *   Prevents double-voting (frontend optimistic update and backend check).
    *   Farcaster API client includes graceful degradation if authentication is not configured.
-   **Testing strategy**: The codebase explicitly states "Missing tests" as a weakness. While there are scripts (`npm run test-db`, `npm run test-tmdb-images`) and dedicated pages (`/test-contract`, `/test-farcaster`, `/test-images`, `/test-real-tmdb`, `/test-tmdb`) for manual testing and debugging, there is no evidence of an automated test suite (unit, integration, E2E tests).

## Readability & Understandability
-   **Code style consistency**: The code generally adheres to a consistent style, typical of modern React/Next.js applications using TypeScript. Tailwind CSS classes are used uniformly for styling, and Shadcn UI components provide a consistent design language.
-   **Documentation quality**:
    *   The `README.md` is comprehensive, covering features, tech stack, local development, environment variables, and database setup.
    *   `FARCASTER_SETUP.md` provides detailed instructions for Farcaster API configuration, including important security warnings.
    *   Inline comments are present in some complex areas (e.g., `src/lib/mongo.ts`, `src/lib/farcaster.ts`, `scripts/build.js`, `scripts/deploy.js`), but could be more thorough, especially for API routes and business logic.
    *   The lack of a dedicated documentation directory is noted as a weakness in the codebase breakdown.
-   **Naming conventions**: Variable, function, component, and file names are generally clear, descriptive, and follow common JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types). API routes are logically named.
-   **Complexity management**: The project manages complexity reasonably well by breaking down features into modular components, dedicated API routes, and utility functions. The use of React hooks helps manage component state and side effects. The `src/lib/mongo.ts` file is quite large and handles many different schemas and operations, which could be refactored into smaller, more focused modules for better maintainability.

## Dependencies & Setup
-   **Dependencies management approach**: Dependencies are managed using `npm` and are clearly listed in `package.json`. The project uses a mix of stable and newer versions of libraries (e.g., Next.js 15, Wagmi 2).
-   **Installation process**: The `README.md` provides clear and concise instructions for local development: `git clone`, `cd Moviemeterminiapp`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`. Environment variable setup (`.env.local`) is also well-documented.
-   **Configuration approach**: Environment variables are central to configuration, managed via `.env.local`. The `scripts/build.js` and `scripts/deploy.js` interact with these variables, prompting the user for necessary inputs (e.g., domain, Farcaster seed phrase) and dynamically updating `.env` files.
-   **Deployment considerations**: The project is configured for Vercel deployment, with `vercel.json` defining build commands and redirects. The `scripts/deploy.js` script provides a robust automation for deploying to Vercel, including Vercel CLI installation, login, project setup, environment variable configuration, and actual deployment. This script is a strong point for simplifying the deployment process.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration**
    *   **Next.js**: Demonstrates strong understanding of Next.js features, including the App Router, server/client components, API routes, dynamic metadata generation (`generateMetadata`), `next/image` for image optimization, and `runtime = "nodejs"` for API routes.
    *   **React**: Effective use of functional components, `useState` for local state, `useEffect` for side effects (data fetching, network switching, referral tag generation), and custom hooks (`useOnboarding`).
    *   **Wagmi/Viem**: Correctly configured for Celo blockchain interaction, utilizing `useAccount`, `useChainId`, `useSwitchChain`, `useWriteContract`, `useBalance`, and `useWalletClient`. `viem`'s `encodeFunctionData` is used for precise contract interaction. The `useAutoConnect` custom hook enhances user experience by attempting to connect to Warpcast automatically.
    *   **Mongoose/MongoDB**: Robust implementation of Mongoose schemas for various data models (`Movie`, `Vote`, `Comment`, `Watchlist`, `Notification`, `Points`). Utilizes advanced features like compound indexes, aggregation pipelines (for leaderboards and comments), and careful connection management (`connectMongo`) to prevent multiple connections.
    *   **Farcaster SDKs**: Integrates `@farcaster/frame-sdk` and `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` for Farcaster Mini App functionality. The custom Farcaster API client in `src/lib/farcaster.ts` is a good decision to reduce external dependencies (e.g., Neynar) and provides a clear, controlled interface.
    *   **Thirdweb**: Used in the admin panel to facilitate on-chain movie addition, demonstrating awareness of smart contract interaction patterns and potential relayer services.
    *   **Shadcn UI/Tailwind CSS**: Leveraged effectively to create a consistent, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.
    *   **NextAuth**: Implemented for Farcaster authentication, showcasing a standard approach to identity management in Next.js applications.
2.  **API Design and Implementation**
    *   The API routes are well-structured in `src/app/api`, following a RESTful-like pattern (e.g., `/api/movies`, `/api/comments`).
    *   `POST` requests often use an `action` parameter to differentiate between various operations on a resource (e.g., "add", "vote", "getUserVotes"), which is a common pattern for GraphQL-like flexibility over REST.
    *   Dynamic OpenGraph image generation (`/api/opengraph-image`) is a clever use of Next.js for social sharing.
    *   A Farcaster webhook endpoint (`/api/webhook`) is implemented to handle frame lifecycle events and notifications.
3.  **Database Interactions**
    *   Comprehensive data modeling with Mongoose schemas, including `timestamps` and custom `id` fields for movies.
    *   Efficient data retrieval using `find`, `findOneAndUpdate`, `updateOne`, `countDocuments`.
    *   Complex data aggregation is used for leaderboards and fetching comments with movie details, demonstrating advanced MongoDB query capabilities.
    *   The `getNextMovieId` function ensures sequential movie IDs, which is useful for blockchain integration.
4.  **Frontend Implementation**
    *   Modular and reusable React components (e.g., `MovieCard`, `CommentsSection`, `WatchlistButton`).
    *   Effective use of React state (`useState`) and lifecycle (`useEffect`) hooks for managing UI state, data fetching, and component interactions.
    *   Conditional rendering is extensively used for loading states, empty data messages, and the onboarding flow, providing a good user experience.
    *   Responsive design is achieved through Tailwind CSS, ensuring usability across different devices.
    *   Interactive elements like carousels (`src/components/ui/carousel.tsx`) and modals (for trailers) are well-implemented.
    *   The onboarding screen (`OnboardingScreen.tsx`) provides an engaging first-time user experience.
5.  **Performance Optimization**
    *   Next.js `Image` component is used for optimized image loading, including `priority` for critical images.
    *   Caching strategies are applied to API calls (e.g., `cache: "force-cache"` for static TMDB config, `cache: "no-store"` for dynamic data).
    *   Client-side data fetching for dynamic content reduces server load.
    *   `useEffect` dependencies are generally correctly specified to prevent unnecessary re-renders and API calls.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Address Critical Security Vulnerabilities Immediately**:
    *   **Farcaster Private Key Exposure**: Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_PRIVATE_KEY` from client-side exposure. All Farcaster API calls requiring a private key (e.g., for `generateAuthToken`) *must* be moved to a secure server-side environment (e.g., a dedicated Next.js API route or server action). The current implementation is a severe security risk.
    *   **Admin Page Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and authorization for the `/admin` route and all sensitive API endpoints it uses (e.g., `/api/movies` with `action: "add"`, `/api/movies/retract`, `/api/import/tmdb`, `/api/thirdweb`). Only authorized users should be able to access these functionalities.
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Review all API routes to ensure thorough server-side input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data, preventing potential injection attacks or data corruption.
2.  **Implement a Comprehensive Automated Test Suite**:
    *   Introduce unit tests (e.g., Jest/React Testing Library) for utility functions, custom hooks, and individual components.
    *   Add integration tests for API routes and database interactions.
    *   Implement end-to-end tests (e.g., Playwright/Cypress) for critical user flows like voting, commenting, and watchlist management. This is crucial for maintaining correctness and preventing regressions.
3.  **Enhance User Feedback and Error Management**:
    *   Replace simple `alert()` messages with a more sophisticated, non-intrusive notification system (e.g., toast messages) for blockchain transaction statuses, API errors, and user actions.
    *   Provide clearer, actionable guidance for users encountering issues, such as linking to a Celo faucet if the balance is insufficient for gas fees.
4.  **Improve Smart Contract Integration and Robustness**:
    *   Fully implement the `syncContentToContract` logic in the admin panel to actually add movies to the Thirdweb smart contract.
    *   Consider adding more robust checks at the smart contract level (e.g., preventing duplicate movie titles or IDs being added).
    *   Explore implementing a gasless transaction strategy (e.g., using a relayer service like OpenZeppelin Defender or Biconomy) for user interactions like voting to improve user experience by abstracting away gas fees.
5.  **Refactor `src/lib/mongo.ts` and Frontend Layout**:
    *   Break down the `src/lib/mongo.ts` file into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., `movie.service.ts`, `comment.service.ts`) to improve maintainability and readability.
    *   Streamline the frontend layout structure. The current setup with `src/app/providers.tsx` and `src/components/providers/Providers.tsx`, combined with `ConditionalLayout`, could be simplified to avoid redundancy and potential issues with context providers and layout rendering.
