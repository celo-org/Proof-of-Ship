## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 4.0/10 | ZKP concept is strong, but `minimumAge: 5` disclosure and client-side `localStorage` for verification data are significant vulnerabilities. API error responses also return `200` for bad requests. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 6.0/10 | Core features are implemented with optimistic UI and real-time updates. However, the fundamental "human verification" is undermined by a `minimumAge: 5` setting in the ZKP configuration, making the primary goal functionally incorrect. No tests. |
| Readability & Understandability | 7.0/10 | Code is generally well-structured with TypeScript and clear naming. `README.md` is good. Some inline styling and lack of detailed comments in complex data fetching logic reduce the score. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 6.5/10 | Uses standard, well-maintained libraries and a clear `package.json`. Environment variables are used. Lacks contribution guidelines, dedicated documentation, comprehensive config examples, and CI/CD. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 7.0/10 | Good Next.js and Supabase integration, including real-time and RPC. Optimistic UI is well-implemented. However, significant N+1 query patterns in data fetching functions (`getPosts`, `getChats`, `getMessages`, `getReplies`) are a major performance anti-pattern. |
| **Overall Score** | 6.1/10 | Weighted average: (Security * 0.20) + (Functionality * 0.25) + (Readability * 0.15) + (Dependencies * 0.10) + (Technical Usage * 0.30) = (4.0 * 0.20) + (6.0 * 0.25) + (7.0 * 0.15) + (6.5 * 0.10) + (7.0 * 0.30) = 0.8 + 1.5 + 1.05 + 0.65 + 2.1 = 6.1 |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** To create a social media platform, "Hyumane," focused on fostering genuine human connections by verifying every profile using zero-knowledge (zk) technology.
- **Problem solved:** Addresses the growing presence of bots and AI-generated content on social media, which leads to fake engagements, spam, lack of trust, and loss of real connections.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** Individuals seeking authentic digital interactions and a bot-free social environment.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript (predominantly), JavaScript, CSS.
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:**
    - Frontend: Next.js (React framework), React, Tailwind CSS.
    - Backend/Database: Supabase (as BaaS for database, authentication, storage, real-time).
    - ZK Verification: `@selfxyz/core`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`, `@selfxyz/contracts` (Self Protocol).
    - Utilities: `uuid` for ID generation.
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js for Next.js server-side operations and API routes, browser for client-side React. Deployment is likely on Vercel, as indicated by the hardcoded endpoint `https://hyumane.vercel.app/api/verify`.

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** A standard Next.js application structure with an `app/` directory for pages and API routes, and a `lib/` directory for shared utility functions (Supabase actions).
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `app/`: Contains all routing logic and UI components (e.g., `page.tsx` for landing, `feed/`, `chat/`, `discover/`, `profile/`, `verify/`). Also includes Next.js API routes (`api/verify/route.ts`).
    - `lib/supabase-actions.ts`: Centralizes all interactions with the Supabase backend (CRUD operations for profiles, posts, likes, replies, follows, chats, messages, and file uploads).
    - `lib/supabase.ts`: Initializes the Supabase client.
    - `eslint.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`: Configuration files for linting, Next.js, PostCSS/Tailwind, and TypeScript.
- **Code organization assessment:** The organization is logical for a Next.js project. Separation of concerns is generally good, with UI components in `app/` and backend interaction logic in `lib/`. However, the `lib/supabase-actions.ts` file is quite large and handles many different concerns, which could be further modularized (e.g., `lib/profile-actions.ts`, `lib/post-actions.ts`, etc.).

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:**
    - **Authentication:** Primarily relies on the Self Protocol for zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based human verification via the `SelfQRcodeWrapper` component and `SelfBackendVerifier` API route.
    - **Authorization:** Not explicitly detailed in the provided code digest. User sessions are managed client-side in `localStorage` (`verifiedUserData`), which is then used to fetch user profiles from Supabase. Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) would be critical for proper authorization, but its configuration is not visible.
- **Data validation and sanitization:**
    - Basic presence checks for required parameters are done in the `/api/verify` route and in `supabase-actions.ts` before database insertions.
    - Input fields in frontend components have `required` attributes, but server-side validation is minimal beyond presence checks.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:**
    - **ZKP Configuration Weakness:** The `SelfAppBuilder` in `app/verify/page.tsx` sets `minimumAge: 5`. This completely undermines the platform's core promise of "real human connections" and "bot-proof" verification, as a 5-year-old is unlikely to be the target demographic for a social media platform, and it doesn't prevent sophisticated bots from passing. This is a critical functional and security flaw.
    - **Client-Side Session Storage:** Storing `verifiedUserData` directly in `localStorage` is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If an XSS vulnerability exists, an attacker could steal the `userId` and impersonate the user. Secure, HTTP-only cookies are generally preferred for session management.
    - **CORS Configuration:** The `/api/verify` route sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, which is permissive. While acceptable for public APIs, it should be restricted to known frontend origins if possible for enhanced security.
    - **API Error Responses:** The `/api/verify` endpoint returns `status: 200` even for `INVALID_INPUTS` errors, which is misleading and can hinder client-side error handling. HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request`) should accurately reflect the error.
    - **N+1 Queries:** While not a direct security vulnerability, inefficient data fetching could lead to denial-of-service if an attacker can trigger many expensive queries.
- **Secret management approach:** Supabase API keys are managed via environment variables (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!`, `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!`), which is standard and appropriate for client-side access. Server-side secrets (if any) are not explicitly shown but would typically follow similar environment variable patterns.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:**
    - User verification via Self Protocol ZKP.
    - Profile creation and editing (username, bio, interests, avatar upload).
    - Social Feed: Displaying posts, creating new posts (with image upload), liking/unliking, replying. Supports "Following" and "Everyone" feeds.
    - Discover: Finding other users, viewing their profiles, following/unfollowing, initiating chats.
    - Chat: One-to-one messaging with real-time updates.
    - Follow System: Users can follow and unfollow others.
- **Error handling approach:**
    - `try-catch` blocks are used in most client-side data fetching and submission functions, logging errors to the console.
    - API routes return `NextResponse.json` with `status: "error"` and specific `error_code` for API failures.
    - Frontend components display loading states and messages for empty data (e.g., "No posts yet").
- **Edge case handling:**
    - Handles scenarios where `verifiedUserData` is missing in `localStorage`, redirecting to `/verify`.
    - Handles cases where a user is verified but has no profile, redirecting to `/create-profile`.
    - Displays appropriate messages for empty feeds, chat lists, or search results.
    - Optimistic UI updates are used for actions like posting, liking, and following, improving perceived responsiveness.
- **Testing strategy:**
    - **Weakness:** As indicated by GitHub metrics, there is no evidence of a test suite (`Missing tests`). This is a major concern for correctness, as changes could introduce regressions without automated checks.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:**
    - Generally consistent use of TypeScript, `async/await`, and component-based architecture.
    - ESLint configuration (`next/core-web-vitals`, `next/typescript`) suggests adherence to Next.js/React best practices.
    - However, there's an inconsistency in styling: While Tailwind CSS is configured, many components (e.g., `app/page.tsx`, `app/chat/page.tsx`) use extensive inline `style` attributes, which can make them harder to read and maintain compared to pure Tailwind classes.
- **Documentation quality:**
    - The `README.md` is comprehensive and provides an excellent overview of the project's vision, problem, solution, and technology stack.
    - Inline comments are sparse, especially in more complex logic within `lib/supabase-actions.ts`.
- **Naming conventions:**
    - Variable, function, and component names are generally descriptive and follow common JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components).
- **Complexity management:**
    - Frontend components manage their state and interactions well.
    - The `lib/supabase-actions.ts` file, while centralizing Supabase logic, has grown quite large and contains complex data fetching logic (e.g., `getPosts` with multiple nested Supabase calls), which could be refactored for better modularity and reduced cognitive load.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** Standard `package.json` with `npm` (or `yarn`) for dependency management. Dependencies are up-to-date (Next.js 14, React 18).
- **Installation process:** Inferred from `package.json` scripts: `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` for local development. This is standard for Next.js projects.
- **Configuration approach:**
    - Uses `.env` files for Supabase keys, accessed via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!`.
    - Next.js, ESLint, PostCSS/Tailwind are configured via their respective configuration files (`next.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`).
    - The `SelfAppBuilder` configuration is hardcoded in `app/verify/page.tsx`, including the Celo contract address.
- **Deployment considerations:**
    - The project is designed for serverless deployment (Next.js API routes, Supabase backend).
    - The hardcoded endpoint `https://hyumane.vercel.app/api/verify` suggests Vercel as the target deployment platform.
    - **Weakness:** GitHub metrics indicate "No CI/CD configuration," meaning deployment and testing are manual, which increases the risk of errors and slows down development. "Missing configuration file examples" could make setup harder for new contributors.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1.  **Framework/Library Integration:**
    -   **Next.js:** Well-integrated using `app` router, client components (`"use client"`), API routes, `next/navigation` for routing, and built-in font optimization.
    -   **React:** Standard functional components, `useState`, `useEffect` for state and lifecycle management. `Suspense` is used for initial loading.
    -   **Supabase:** Excellent integration for database operations, file storage (`avatars`, `post-images`), and real-time subscriptions (`supabase.channel().on().subscribe()`). The use of `supabase.rpc('get_or_create_chat')` demonstrates awareness of advanced Supabase features for atomic operations.
    -   **Self Protocol (SelfXYZ):** Correctly integrated for ZKP human verification using `SelfAppBuilder` and `SelfQRcodeWrapper` on the frontend, and `SelfBackendVerifier` on the backend.
    -   **Tailwind CSS:** Configured and used, though inconsistent application with inline styles.
2.  **API Design and Implementation:**
    -   A single Next.js API route (`app/api/verify/route.ts`) is provided, handling `POST` and `OPTIONS` requests.
    -   CORS headers are correctly set for `OPTIONS` and `POST`.
    -   Request body parsing and parameter extraction are handled.
    -   Responses are JSON-formatted, with `status` and `error_code` fields for errors.
    -   **Weakness:** As noted, returning `200 OK` for client-side input errors is incorrect HTTP status usage.
3.  **Database Interactions:**
    -   Extensive use of the `supabase-js` client library for CRUD operations across profiles, posts, likes, replies, follows, and chats.
    -   `supabase.storage` is used for avatar and post image uploads.
    -   `supabase.rpc` is leveraged for `get_or_create_chat`, which is a good pattern for encapsulating complex, transactional logic directly in the database.
    -   **Major Weakness (N+1 Queries):** Several data fetching functions (`getPosts`, `getChats`, `getMessages`, `getReplies`) exhibit the N+1 query problem. They fetch a list of primary entities, then loop through each entity to fetch related data (e.g., author profiles, like counts, reply counts) with separate database calls. This becomes extremely inefficient as the number of entities grows, severely impacting performance. This could be optimized using Supabase's foreign table joins or by creating more comprehensive RPC functions.
4.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    -   Clear UI component structure, with pages composed of logical sections (Navbar, Hero, Feed, etc.).
    -   Effective state management using `useState` and `useEffect` for dynamic content and user interactions.
    -   Optimistic UI updates for likes, follows, and post creation significantly improve user experience by providing immediate feedback.
    -   Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions are well-implemented for chat and feed, ensuring data freshness.
    -   Responsive design is implied by Tailwind CSS, but not explicitly tested or detailed. Accessibility considerations are not evident.
5.  **Performance Optimization:**
    -   Optimistic UI and real-time features enhance perceived performance.
    -   `Promise.all` is used in `getFollowStats` to fetch multiple pieces of data concurrently, which is good.
    -   **Major Weakness:** The N+1 query problem in data fetching functions is a critical performance bottleneck that will degrade application responsiveness and increase database load as user and data volumes grow. Caching strategies are not explicitly visible beyond Supabase's default.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Address Critical Security & Functional Flaws:**
    *   **Reconfigure ZKP `minimumAge`:** Change `minimumAge: 5` to a more appropriate value (e.g., 18 or 21) in `app/verify/page.tsx` to genuinely fulfill the "real human verification" promise.
    *   **Secure Session Management:** Replace `localStorage` for `verifiedUserData` with more secure mechanisms like HTTP-only, secure cookies to mitigate XSS risks.
    *   **Correct API Error Status Codes:** Ensure `/api/verify/route.ts` returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for invalid input) instead of `200 OK` for errors.
2.  **Optimize Database Interactions (N+1 Query Resolution):**
    *   Refactor `getPosts`, `getChats`, `getMessages`, and `getReplies` in `lib/supabase-actions.ts` to use Supabase's `rpc` functions with SQL joins or `foreign table joins` to fetch all related data in a single, efficient query. This is crucial for scalability and performance.
3.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Develop a robust test suite, including unit tests for `lib/supabase-actions.ts`, integration tests for API routes, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows (e.g., verification, profile creation, posting, chatting). This is vital for ensuring correctness and preventing regressions.
4.  **Enhance Project Maintainability & Collaboration:**
    *   **Modularize `supabase-actions.ts`:** Break down the large `lib/supabase-actions.ts` file into smaller, domain-specific modules (e.g., `profile.ts`, `posts.ts`, `chat.ts`).
    *   **Standardize Styling:** Consolidate styling to use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively, removing inline `style` attributes to improve readability and maintainability.
    *   **Add CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes.
    *   **Improve Documentation:** Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, a formal `LICENSE` file, and consider a dedicated `docs/` directory for more detailed technical documentation or API specifications.
5.  **Future Development Directions:**
    *   **Implement AI Content Detection (V2):** Develop the planned AI content classifier to filter non-human generated content, further strengthening the platform's core value proposition.
    *   **Expanded ZK Use-Cases:** Explore extending ZK-verification to content authorship, voting, or other features as outlined in the `README.md`.
    *   **Notifications System:** Add real-time notifications for new messages, likes, and replies.
    *   **Enhanced User Discovery:** Implement more sophisticated user discovery features, such as interest-based matching or suggested follows.
