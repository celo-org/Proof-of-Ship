## Project Summary
AdsBazaar is envisioned as the first global multi-currency influencer marketing platform. Its primary purpose is to decentralize influencer marketing, enabling businesses to pay and influencers to earn in local stablecoins (e.g., Naira, Shillings, Euros) powered by Mento Protocol and the Celo ecosystem.

The project aims to solve critical pain points in the traditional influencer marketing industry:
*   **Payment Fraud & Delays**: By using smart contract escrows for guaranteed payments.
*   **High Platform Fees**: Offering a significantly lower 0.5% fee compared to industry standards (15-30%).
*   **USD-only Payments**: Providing true global access with 6 local currencies via Mento Protocol.
*   **Complex Crypto Onboarding**: Facilitating direct fiat on-ramps (e.g., bank transfer, M-Pesa to stablecoins).
*   **Fake Influencer Epidemics**: Implementing zero-knowledge identity verification via Self Protocol and Farcaster social proof.
*   **Payment Disputes**: Utilizing automated blockchain resolution with community-driven conflict resolution.

Its target users and beneficiaries are global businesses (brands, advertisers) looking for efficient, transparent, and cost-effective marketing, and influencers (creators) seeking guaranteed payments, fair fees, and access to a wider, local-currency-supported market.

## Technology Stack
*   **Main Programming Languages**: TypeScript (76.38%), Solidity (15.05%), JavaScript (8.54%), CSS (0.03%).
*   **Key Frameworks and Libraries**:
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, Wagmi, RainbowKit, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, `@mento-protocol/mento-sdk`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`, `@farcaster/auth-kit`, `@neynar/nodejs-sdk` (for Farcaster integration), `@supabase/supabase-js` (for off-chain data).
    *   **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (versions 0.8.18+), Foundry (for development, testing, deployment), Hardhat (alternative deployment), OpenZeppelin Contracts, `@selfxyz/contracts` (for Self Protocol).
    *   **Web3 Utilities**: Viem (for low-level blockchain interaction), Ethers (for Mento SDK compatibility).
    *   **Referral Tracking**: `@divvi/referral-sdk`.
*   **Inferred Runtime Environment(s)**: Node.js (for Next.js server-side rendering and API routes), EVM-compatible blockchain (specifically Celo mainnet and Alfajores testnet).

## Architecture and Structure
The project adopts a modern, modular architecture, particularly notable in its smart contract design:
*   **Overall Project Structure**: The repository is divided into `frontend/` (Next.js application) and `upgradeable-contract/` (Solidity smart contracts). A root `README.md` provides an overview, while dedicated `README.md` files exist within subdirectories for more specific details.
*   **Key Modules/Components and their Roles**:
    *   **Smart Contracts (Diamond Pattern - EIP-2535)**: This is the core backend. It uses a `Diamond` proxy contract that delegates calls to various `Facet` contracts. This allows for modularity and upgradeability. Key facets include:
        *   `DiamondCutFacet`, `DiamondLoupeFacet`, `OwnershipFacet`: Standard EIP-2535 components.
        *   `UserManagementFacet`: Handles user registration, profile updates, and platform fee settings.
        *   `ApplicationManagementFacet`: Manages campaign applications and influencer selection.
        *   `MultiCurrencyCampaignFacet`: The central piece for creating, canceling (with/without compensation), expiring, and managing multi-currency campaigns. It supersedes a deprecated `CampaignManagementFacet`.
        *   `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet`: Handles multi-currency payment claims (individual or bulk) and user-preferred token settings. It supersedes a deprecated `PaymentManagementFacet`.
        *   `DisputeManagementFacet`: Manages dispute resolvers, flagging, resolving, and expiring disputes.
        *   `ProofManagementFacet`: For influencers to submit proof of work and for auto-approval mechanisms.
        *   `SelfVerificationFacet`: Integrates Self Protocol for ZK identity verification.
        *   `GettersFacet`: Provides various `view` functions for reading contract state (briefs, users, stats).
        *   `SparkCampaignFacet`: Manages "Spark Campaigns" for viral Farcaster promotions, including creation, participation, and verification.
    *   **Libraries (`LibAdsBazaar`, `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar`, `LibDiamond`)**: Provide shared data structures, constants, events, and utility functions for the facets. `LibMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar` is critical for managing the multi-currency logic and token addresses.
    *   **Frontend (Next.js Application)**:
        *   **App Router**: Utilizes Next.js's modern app router for routing and data fetching.
        *   **Components**: Modular UI components (e.g., `CampaignCard`, `CurrencyConverter`).
        *   **Hooks**: Extensive custom React hooks (e.g., `useMultiCurrencyCampaignCreation`, `useMultiCurrencyPayments`, `usePlatformStats`, `useSparkCampaign`, `useDivviIntegration`) abstract blockchain interactions and state management.
        *   **API Routes**: Next.js API routes serve as a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer for off-chain services like Farcaster profile fetching (via Neynar), campaign share tracking (via Supabase), and dispute details.
*   **Code Organization Assessment**: The project demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, especially with the diamond pattern for smart contracts. Frontend code is well-organized into `components`, `hooks`, `lib`, `utils`, and `app` directories. The explicit documentation for multi-currency integration and deployment scripts is a strong point.

## Security Analysis
*   **Authentication & Authorization Mechanisms**:
    *   **Wallet-based Authentication**: Users connect their Web3 wallets (MetaMask, RainbowKit) for identity.
    *   **Farcaster Authentication**: Integrated using `@farcaster/auth-kit` for social proof and potentially deeper Farcaster-specific interactions.
    *   **Smart Contract Authorization**: The `OwnershipFacet` implements `IERC173` for contract ownership. Various facets use internal `enforceOwner()`, `enforceBusiness()`, `enforceInfluencer()`, and `enforceDisputeResolver()` modifiers (defined in `LibAdsBazaar`) to control access to specific functions based on user roles.
*   **Data Validation and Sanitization**:
    *   **On-chain Validation**: Smart contracts include `require` statements for critical input validation (e.g., `_budget > 0`, `_maxInfluencers` limits, `username` length, valid `_targetAudience`, valid timing periods).
    *   **Frontend Validation**: Basic input validation is present in forms (e.g., `applicationMessage` length).
*   **Potential Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Reentrancy**: The `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` is correctly applied to critical functions like `claimPaymentsInToken` and `claimAllPendingPayments` in `MultiCurrencyPaymentFacet`, and `createSparkCampaign` and `cancelSparkCampaign` in `SparkCampaignFacet`.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Solidity version 0.8.18+ is used, which has built-in safe math to prevent these issues.
    *   **Access Control Logic**: While role-based modifiers are used, a thorough audit would be needed to ensure no bypasses or unintended access patterns exist across the numerous facets and their interactions. The `addPendingPaymentInToken` function is currently restricted to `owner`, which is a pragmatic temporary measure but could be a centralized point if not managed carefully in a decentralized context.
    *   **Lack of Comprehensive Testing**: The most significant security weakness is the explicit absence of a comprehensive test suite for the Solidity contracts. Without rigorous testing, even well-intentioned security measures may contain subtle bugs. The `contract/test/AdsBazaar.t.sol` is commented out.
    *   **Oracle Manipulation**: The project relies on Mento Protocol for exchange rates. While Mento is designed for stability, any external dependency carries inherent risks. The platform itself doesn't directly implement a price oracle, mitigating direct manipulation but inheriting Mento's robustness.
*   **Secret Management Approach**: Environment variables (`.env` files) are used for private keys, RPC URLs, and API keys (Neynar, Supabase), which is standard practice for securing sensitive information.

## Functionality & Correctness
*   **Core Functionalities Implemented**:
    *   **User Management**: Registration as business or influencer, profile updates (including social media links), username management (availability check).
    *   **Multi-Currency Campaign Lifecycle**: Creation of ad briefs with various currencies (cUSD, cEUR, cNGN, etc.), selection of influencers, content submission by influencers, business review and approval, and campaign completion.
    *   **Payment System**: Multi-currency payment claims (individual or all pending), compensation for cancelled campaigns, platform fee collection.
    *   **Dispute Resolution**: Flagging submissions, adding/removing dispute resolvers, resolving disputes (valid/invalid), and expiring disputes.
    *   **Self Protocol Integration**: Zero-knowledge identity verification for influencers.
    *   **Farcaster Integration**: Social proofing for influencers, and "Spark Campaigns" for viral Farcaster promotions (create, participate, verify/claim rewards).
    *   **Fiat On/Off-Ramps**: Integration with Kotani Pay and Alchemy Pay (mocked for demo, but infrastructure planned) for local currency funding.
*   **Error Handling Approach**:
    *   **Solidity**: Extensive use of `require()` statements for preconditions and `revert()` for custom error messages. Custom errors like `RegisteredNullifier()` are defined.
    *   **Frontend**: `try-catch` blocks in React hooks and API routes handle transaction failures and API errors. `react-hot-toast` provides user-friendly notifications. A `parseSmartContractError` utility helps extract meaningful messages from blockchain reverts.
*   **Edge Case Handling**:
    *   Checks for `budget > 0`, `maxInfluencers` limits, valid `username` length, valid timing periods (`applicationPeriod`, `promotionDuration`, etc.).
    *   Handles scenarios like influencers already applied, campaign spots full, deadlines passed (e.g., `Application period has ended`, `Proof submission period has ended`).
    *   `_finalizeExpiredDisputes` function handles disputes that are not resolved within their deadline, marking them as `EXPIRED`.
    *   `canExpireCampaign` and `isCampaignAwaitingDecision` utilities provide detailed logic for various campaign states.
*   **Testing Strategy**: **This is a critical weakness.**
    *   The `contract/test/AdsBazaar.t.sol` file is commented out, indicating no active Solidity unit tests are being run.
    *   The `frontend/test-*.js` and `frontend/test-frontend-multicurrency.tsx` files appear to be ad-hoc debugging and manual verification scripts rather than a comprehensive, automated test suite.
    *   The `BUILD_STATUS.md` and codebase weaknesses explicitly list "Missing tests" and "No CI/CD configuration" as major gaps.
    *   The `contract/.github/workflows/test.yml` only performs `forge fmt --check` and `forge build --sizes` and `forge test -vvv` (which would fail if tests are commented out), indicating a very basic CI setup.
    *   Without a robust test suite, the correctness of complex smart contract logic and multi-currency interactions cannot be reliably guaranteed.

## Readability & Understandability
*   **Code Style Consistency**:
    *   **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Generally consistent camelCase, clear variable names. ESLint configuration is present (`eslint.config.mjs`), although `strict: false` in `tsconfig.json` suggests some flexibility for type errors.
    *   **Solidity**: Follows common Solidity style (PascalCase for contracts/libraries/structs, camelCase for functions/variables).
*   **Documentation Quality**:
    *   **Comprehensive READMEs**: The root `README.md` and `MENTO_MULTICURRENCY_INTEGRATION.md` provide excellent high-level overviews, problem statements, solutions, architecture diagrams (Mermaid), and detailed user flows. `MULTICURRENCY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` offers a clear technical guide for frontend integration.
    *   **Inline Comments**: Present in Solidity contracts, explaining complex logic and state variables. Frontend code has some comments, especially in hooks and utility functions.
    *   **Type Definitions**: Extensive TypeScript interfaces (`types/index.ts`, `types/social.ts`) greatly enhance understanding of data structures.
*   **Naming Conventions**: Clear and descriptive naming for variables, functions, and components (e.g., `createAdBriefWithToken`, `useMultiCurrencyCampaignCreation`, `DisputeManagementFacet`). Enums (`CampaignStatus`, `TargetAudience`) are well-defined.
*   **Complexity Management**:
    *   **Modular Smart Contracts**: The EIP-2535 Diamond pattern effectively breaks down complex contract logic into smaller, manageable facets, improving maintainability and upgradeability.
    *   **Modular Frontend Hooks**: Custom React hooks encapsulate specific blockchain interactions, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
    *   **Utility Functions**: Well-organized utility files (`campaignUtils.ts`, `format.ts`, `socialMedia.ts`) centralize common logic.
    *   **Frontend Build Complexity**: `BUILD_STATUS.md` highlights challenges with TypeScript complexity, large dependency resolution, and circular dependencies, indicating that while the code is modular, the build process itself has become complex.

## Dependencies & Setup
*   **Dependencies Management Approach**:
    *   **Frontend**: `npm` (or `yarn`) is used, with a comprehensive `package.json` listing modern Next.js, React, and Web3 libraries.
    *   **Smart Contracts**: `Foundry` is the primary toolchain, with `hardhat` as an alternative. `npm` manages Solidity-specific libraries (OpenZeppelin, SelfXYZ).
*   **Installation Process**: The `README.md` files provide clear `git clone`, `npm install`, and `npm run dev` instructions for the frontend, and `npm install` and `forge script` for contract deployment.
*   **Configuration Approach**:
    *   `.env` files are used for sensitive information (private keys, API keys, RPC URLs) and configurable parameters (`HASHED_SCOPE`).
    *   `lib/contracts.ts` centralizes contract addresses for different networks, making it easy to manage deployments.
    *   `lib/networks.ts` defines supported chains and their configurations.
*   **Deployment Considerations**:
    *   Detailed deployment scripts are provided for both Foundry (`DeployUnifiedMultiCurrency.s.sol`) and Hardhat (`deploy.js`), covering both testnet and mainnet.
    *   The deployment process involves deploying individual facets, then a `Diamond` proxy, and finally performing a `diamondCut` to link the facets and initialize the diamond.
    *   Explicit instructions for obtaining test tokens and contract verification are included.
    *   The `AddMissingGetterFunctions.s.sol` script suggests an iterative deployment/upgrade approach, which is common with diamond patterns.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
The project demonstrates strong technical implementation quality across various aspects:

1.  **Framework/Library Integration**:
    *   **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard**: Implementing this complex standard for modular, upgradeable smart contracts is a significant technical achievement, showcasing advanced Solidity architecture skills.
    *   **Mento Protocol SDK**: Deep integration for multi-currency capabilities (exchange rates, swaps) directly on-chain, enabling the core value proposition of local currency payments. This is a highly specialized and well-executed integration.
    *   **Self Protocol (ZK-SNARKs)**: Integration of zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving identity verification is cutting-edge, demonstrating a commitment to advanced Web3 technologies and user privacy.
    *   **Farcaster (Neynar API, AuthKit, Frame SDK)**: Comprehensive integration for social proof, authentication, and "Spark Campaign" mechanics, leveraging modern social primitives of Web3. The `farcaster.json` and `app/mini-app/campaign/` structure indicates a dedicated Farcaster Mini-App.
    *   **Next.js 15 & React 19**: Using the latest versions of these frameworks, combined with `Wagmi` and `RainbowKit`, indicates a modern and capable frontend stack.
    *   **Divvi Referral SDK**: Shows awareness of growth and tracking tools in the Web3 space.
    *   **Foundry**: Efficient and robust tooling for Solidity development.

2.  **API Design and Implementation**:
    *   **Next.js API Routes**: Used effectively to create a backend-for-frontend layer, handling interactions with external services (Neynar for Farcaster, Supabase for share tracking) and providing data to the frontend (e.g., `api/og/campaign` for Open Graph images).
    *   **RESTful Design**: API routes generally follow RESTful principles for resource access (e.g., `api/brief-applications/[briefId]`).
    *   **OG Image Generation**: Dynamically generates Open Graph images for campaigns, enhancing social sharing.

3.  **Database Interactions**:
    *   **Supabase**: Utilized for off-chain data storage, specifically for tracking `campaign_shares`. The `migrations/add_campaign_shares_table.sql` file demonstrates proper schema management.
    *   **Direct API Interaction**: Frontend interacts directly with Supabase via Next.js API routes, abstracting the database layer.

4.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   **UI Component Structure**: Well-defined and reusable React components (`CampaignCard`, `CurrencyConverter`, various modals).
    *   **State Management**: Leverages React hooks for local component state and `Wagmi` for blockchain-related state (wallet, contracts). Custom hooks (`useMultiCurrencyAdsBazaar`, `usePlatformStats`) centralize complex logic.
    *   **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS is used, and components like `Header` and modals are designed with responsiveness in mind.
    *   **Farcaster Mini-App**: Dedicated implementation for a Farcaster Mini-App, including specific metadata generation (`metadata.ts`).

5.  **Performance Optimization**:
    *   **Caching**: `useReadContract` hooks benefit from Wagmi's built-in caching. `useExchangeRates` implements its own caching logic for Mento rates (`mento-live.ts`).
    *   **Asynchronous Operations**: Extensive use of `async/await` for non-blocking UI during blockchain interactions and API calls.
    *   **Frontend Build Optimization**: While `BUILD_STATUS.md` points out current build issues, the use of `Next.js 15` and `Turbopack` (in `npm run dev`) indicates an intent for high performance.

Overall, the project showcases a high level of technical ambition and competence in integrating a complex array of Web3 and traditional technologies to deliver its core functionality.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
1.  **Implement Comprehensive Test Suites (Critical)**: This is the most urgent and significant area for improvement. Develop thorough unit tests for all Solidity contracts (facets, libraries) using Foundry. Implement integration tests for complex cross-facet interactions and end-to-end tests for critical user flows in the frontend. This will drastically improve reliability, correctness, and security.
2.  **Establish Robust CI/CD Pipelines**: Expand the existing `.github/workflows/test.yml` to automate the execution of the new test suites, code linting, security scanning, and automated deployment to staging environments. This ensures continuous quality assurance and faster, safer releases.
3.  **Address Frontend Build Performance and Type Strictness**: Investigate and resolve the TypeScript complexity, large dependency resolution, and circular dependency issues mentioned in `BUILD_STATUS.md`. Aim for `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` to leverage TypeScript's full benefits for code quality and maintainability.
4.  **Refine Smart Contract Access Control**: While `onlyOwner` is used, consider a more granular role-based access control system (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl.sol) for administrative functions within specific facets. This would decentralize control and reduce reliance on a single owner address for all sensitive operations.
5.  **Expand Documentation and Community Engagement**: Add detailed contribution guidelines, a clear license, and a dedicated documentation directory. This will encourage community adoption, make the project more approachable for new contributors, and clarify legal aspects. Consider creating developer-focused documentation for the various integrations.
