🚖 **Tracks:**

While any project on Celo is eligible, we highly encourage projects that fit into the following tracks:
- **MiniApps:** build a mobile-first mini app on Minipay that solves a local, practical challenge. [See quickstart here.](https://docs.celo.org/developer/build-on-minipay/overview)
- **AI Powered Apps & Agents:** build AI Agents that interact with smart contract on Celo. [See tutorials here.](https://docs.celo.org/developer/build-with-ai/overview)
- **DeFi & Stablecoin Payments:** use [Mento](https://docs.mento.org/mento) stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cCOP) in your app.
- **Infra & Dev Tools:** Improve developer tooling (such as [Celo Composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer) or [Composer Kit](https://github.com/celo-org/composer-kit)) or create projects and tutorials that leverage existing developer tooling (such as [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/celo)).
