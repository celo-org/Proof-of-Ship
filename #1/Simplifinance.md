# Project Name
### Simplifinance
A platform of decentralized pools for short-term lending and borrowing services. At Simplifi, we provide a groundbreaking approach to peer-to-peer group lending and borrowing that combines inclusivity, transparency, and control. While other lending platforms rely on centralized liquidity pools with predetermined and algorithm-driven interest rates, Simplifi flips the script.

## Goal for this Proof of Ship

Simplifinance owns a Web App, Sequel to research we conducted, and in a bid to reach out to more users via an intuitive easy-to-use interface, our goal is to develop a mobile-friendly AI-powered Telegram bot and miniApp (taking bot as first on the list) to onboard more users driving more traffic to our product. As part of our to-dos, we have set out the following tasks to help us achieve our set goal.

## Problem

- High interest rate monopoly.
- Centralized and rigid liquidity pattern.
- Low transparency and exclusion (especially for the lower class of users).

## Solution

- Near-zero interest loans via peer-funding mechanism.
- User-driven liquidity pool through our FlexPool design.
- Enhanced flexibility and inclusion for all class of users.
- Trust and transparency.
- Expandable liquidity.

By blending traditional group lending practices with blockchain tecehnology, Simplifi creates a financial solution that's transparent, inclusive, and uniquely user-focused.

## Architecture

This project is in two parts - a web-app and a mini-app. The frontend part lets users interact with the backend built into smart contracts. The mini-app, targeted at mobile devices uses an AI powered bot-like mechanism with Smart wallet integration to ease user interaction, povides notification services to users about important events such as the getFinance time, payback time, who is getting finance, grace periods, liquidation attemps, and overall information about their positions etc.
In the future, our plan is to have Simplifinance run on multiple chains
