## Problem
The adoption of blockchain technology and Web3 has been slow, largely due to the complexities associated with onboarding new users. While decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain offer transformative potential, their interfaces and user experiences are intimidating for non-technical users. As of today, the majority of Web3 users are crypto enthusiasts and developers, leaving behind a massive untapped audience.

## Solution
Start3 seeks to address these challenges by creating a comprehensive onboarding platform for Web3. We envision a world where interacting with decentralized technologies is as simple as using any modern mobile application. Start3 will guide users, step-by-step, through the creation of wallets, participation in decentralized finance (DeFi), and exploration of blockchain-based games, NFTs, and more. Our platform aims to bring the next billion users on-chain by making Web3 accessible, secure, and rewarding.
