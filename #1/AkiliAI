# Project Name
AkiliAI - AI Utilities and Personal Payment Assistant on Celo Mini Pay

## Goal for this Proof of Ship
Week 1:
- Smart contract development for utility payment handling 
- Defining possible parameters (Utilities to start with and timeframe for others)
- Logic and API development (Make agent actions and routes and test)

Week 2:
- Integration
- AI agent actions test and contract tests

Week 3:
- User dashboard development (Either as chat agent or interface)

Week 4:
- Going to mainnet and further tests

## Problem
- Generating monthly reports summary and cost-cutting recommendations
- Manual utility bill management is time-consuming and prone to missed payments
- Current solutions lack AI-powered optimization and automated payment capabilities on blockchain

## Solution
AkiliAI automates utility payments using Celo's blockchain and AI:
- Automated bill payments with spending caps
- Smart scheduling of payments
- Cost analysis and optimization recommendations
- Monthly spending reports
- Integration with utility providers

## Architecture
- Frontend: Celo Composer
- Smart Contracts: Solidity on Celo
- AI Integration: OpenAI API
- Payment: Celo stablecoins (cUSD)

## Deployed Contract Addresses on Celo
Contracts should be verified
