## Detailed description of the work you did during the contest

 I developed smart contracts using Solidity, deployed to the Celo blockchain and connected my dApp to the blockchain network using viem and wagmi. Most of the apps built where designed to be compatible with Minipay.

## Problem
Some of the problems Neurobot aims to solve include
1. Friction when using multiple AI tools
2. Difficulty in analyzing the current market state
3. Challenges trying to can quick answers on Web3 niched topics

## Solution
With the increase in awareness of the potentials of artificial intelligence (AI) Neurobots aims to:

1. Leverage AI for automating tasks on the blockchain
2. Get current chain activities such as top performing tokens, whale purchase, etc
3. Aggregate news that may influence the crypto market
4. Ease the process needed to place an order in the crypto market by analyzing prompts and making decisions accordingly
5. Provide quick answers to niche web3 topics
