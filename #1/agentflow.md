## Goal for this Proof of Ship

The goal of this project is to develop a simple, no-code platform powered by AI agents to assist on/off-ramping service providers in delivering seamless customer support via Telegram, Twitter, or a chatbot.

These AI agents will function autonomously, executing specific actions on behalf of service providers through API calls while ensuring instant communication and feedback with customers. The system is designed to streamline customer interactions, reduce response times, and handle common support tasks efficiently.

## Problem

As a core team member working on OneRamp (a stablecoin on/off-ramp service), I’ve observed first-hand the challenges of providing 24/7 customer support manually.

Some of the key issues we face include:

- Different time zones – Customers come from various regions, making it hard to maintain real-time responses.  
- Network downtimes – Unstable internet connections can delay responses, frustrating users.  
- Language barriers – Customers often reach out in different languages, making communication difficult.  
- Response time expectations – Many platforms, including MiniPay, require ultra-fast customer service. Failure to meet response times led to OneRamp being deplatformed from MiniPay during the holiday season due to a delayed customer response.  

Most customer support tasks we handle are highly repetitive, making them ideal for automation using AI agents.
highly repetitive, making them ideal for automation using AI agents.

## Solution

We are building AgentFlow, a no-code AI agent platform that provides fast, 24/7 customer support on multiple platforms, including Telegram and Twitter.

### Key Features:
- AI agents autonomously handle common support queries.
- Agents can refund orders, process payouts, and provide status updates.
- Service providers no longer need to be online 24/7 to handle repetitive customer requests.

This solution will reduce response times, lower operational costs, and improve user experience, ensuring service providers can meet customer expectations efficiently.
