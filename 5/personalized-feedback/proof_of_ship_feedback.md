## Hey Builders,

First off, amazing work on your PoS submissions â€” every project, whether early-stage or more advanced, brings us a lot of joy to review. Just a few quick reminders and encouragements to help you keep leveling up:

### ðŸ”„ General Completeness of Submission
- **Update your video** every time you add new functionality â€” this isn't just for the judges, it's great training for yourself. Show off your progress.
- **Update your deck** to match your latest build and clarify your narrative. A good story makes your tech more powerful. A good founder works constantly on improving their deck!!
- **Update your README** to match the information on KarmaGAP. This will be used by the agent to compare the techincal implementations and you want it to be up to date to get the best score possible. Discrepancies between README and technical implementation lead to loss of points. 
- Make sure **smart contracts and repositories are correctly connected** to KarmaGAP. This is the data we are using to evaluate your project. If it's not connected, it won't count into your score!

### Presentation IRL and in the video

Please remember that your presentation is the most important thing of your project. This is what people see. So, please follow the guide provided

- Time distribution
  - **1 min** intro to the idea, please use a deck or graphics or something visually pleasing. People have a short attention span and when you just talk over the startscreen of your dap, you loose them. Add highlights of the updates of the month. Also, share about who is your target audience, and how you are different from the competition. 
  - **2 min** walkthrough. Please pre-record and don't do a live demo. Add a voice over, but please with your own voice and not with AI. 
  - **1 min** roadmap, team, challenges, architecture. Create a personal relationship to the viewer.
- Practice your live presentation. Imagine the founders of Celo are watching this and probably a VC. Make sure you stand out. 
- Make sure your tech works. Invest in a better mic and check your recording afterwards for quality. In the end your online communication counts a lot and if people don't understand you, they won't be able to see your fill potential. 
- If you are using AI generated slides, please make sure to check them. I saw so many references to tech that was not in fact used. Don't overload your presentation with AI generated content, it will be too much. 
- Please make sure you don't have too much text on the slides. You will loose the judge and not manage to fully present your idea.

### ðŸ¤– On Using AI
- If you're using AI tools (for slides, docs, UI, etc.), that's awesome â€” just **review the output**. It's your vision; make sure the tech reflects it.
- **Less is more.** Focusing on **one or two core features and making them work beautifully** is more impressive than shipping a broken UI full of potential. Quality > vibe-coded quantity.

Now, onto your personalized feedback. Each note below is tailored to your project, with love and belief in your potential. Let's build.



## Faucet Drops

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/faucet-drops)

**General Feedback:**
- A lot of transactions; great updates since the last time in UI/UX and presentation.
- The team worked a lot and came to the showcase.
- Good at getting transaction volume up.
- Video is already amazing, love the episodic updates and focus on sharing progress.
- The intro could have talking; music and text alone can feel impersonal.
- Newcomers may not understand what is special about the project (e.g., first project on Celo).
- Now that there is a solid MVP, it would be good to clarify the value add and differentiation from competitors; many similar projects exist.
- Consider creating a slide with a matrix comparing the project to competitors.
- Wallet connection didn't work and got a chainID error.
- If the system was tricked, it was done well.
- Check out Cookie Jar for a cleaner, more fun interface and good video demo.
- Some reviewers do not see further usability.
- Impression that there are many other solutions providing the same with more features already.

## GMonchain

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/gmonchain)

- Farcaster app does not have the Celo integration.
- Video does not have any voice.
- Shows first Celo and then Linea.

## Ubeswap

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/ubeswap)

**General Feedback:**
- No commits but transactions.

## Festify

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/festify)

**General Feedback:**
- Please have your pitch in a proper pitch deck, like canva, that you can share.
- Could not find the farcaster app on farcaster.
- Add farcaster user name search.
- Next steps should include the creator part.
- how they can make money etc.
- same feedback as last time.
- for festive cards, you want to add a design feauture.
- make it look more fun or nicer.
- Maybe collab with Minth project.
- Nice project, but not sure about real usability.
- using metrics from 2021, when there was a NFT bubble, reality is much different now - looks unrealistic for investors when the market size is from 2021.
- I'm not sure about the scalability of the project in terms of financial sustainability.

## 3 Wheeler Bike Club

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/3-wheeler-bike-club)

**General Feedback:**
- Website/ dapp does not work.
- Deck is good but not aligned with the video, would be great to have a more in depth competitor analysis.
- Love that the video now is focused only on investors.
- in your next update, mention numbers e.g. transaction numbers etc.
- When will it be possible to actually invest?
- Cool initiative and real use case, can be monetized and grow.
- I see a strong real-world use case here with clear potential for impact.
- Whatâ€™s still unclear to me is how drivers would eventually own their 3-wheel bikes â€” specifically, the timeline and mechanics for that.
- Iâ€™m also curious about how the income-sharing model balances the driverâ€™s contribution (time and effort) with investor returns.

---


## Esusu

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/esusu)

**General Feedback:**

- good user numbers already.
- share more about that in the video and your updates.
- I mean also non technical updates.
- Make sure it works as a farcaster app and a normal app for testing.
- Links to user testing and ambassador program are leading to a 404 good dollar page.
- great that you integrated Good Dollar.
- The scroll in the Farcaster app does not properly work.
- the page is cutoff in the bottom where we have the menu bar.
- the web version did not work.
- no option to connect the wallet.
- Maybe adding smart wallets would be an idea, see Felix approach.
- Not sure about scalability of Business Model.
- Interesting idea! But winning hinges on onboarding, so the GTM strategy is super important, also to get first testers.
- Show, step-by-step, who finds Esusu first, what pain drives them to join, and what earns their trust.
- Then sketch the funnel with clear hooks and rewards at each stage.

## Moviemeter

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/moviemeter-2)

**General Feedback:**
- onchain part is still not clear.
- right now I only sign the transaction for my movie.
- I should be able to provide a comment as well.
- The state management is not working.
- when I reload the page, my votes are not saved/ reflected in the FE.
- Farcaster Frame feature does not work.
- should all be a Farcaster Frame or TG MiniApp.
- would make sense to add incentives and gamification.
- interesting project.
- I would love to see a more detailed GTM, that is not so high level.

---


## Sovereign Seas

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/sovereign-seas)

**General Feedback:**
- great that you added the Farcaster miniapp.
- Good UI update.
- Good job making it more Stable.
- like to have the dynamic swap for the voting.
- Work on the state handling, etc., the payout/distribution.
- Please improve the video so it makes sense for people who have not taken part in proof of ship.
- Is your user target group only web3, then it works, but then it would not work in minipay.
- But it works in farcaster.
- for minipay, you would have to make the user experience much more simple with only voting in stablecoins and much more simple user flow.
- great job in adding good dollar and self.
- should have shown that in the video.

---


## Questpanda

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/questpanda-1)

**General Feedback:**
- please use the video as the chance to share updates from the last month and what you worked on.

- updates on partnership with bibyt is exciting.
- go for it! you are on the right path.
- Make sure to check the technical feedback.
- your score has not improved since the last time.
- Good tool for collaborative content.
- a marketplace for content creation seems interesting if we can keep the quality of the inouts.

---


## ChamaPay

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/chamapay)

**General Feedback:**
- Make sure all of your team has filled out your profile on KarmaGAP.
- don't have Johns information on KarmaGAP, only in the deck.
- to the farcaster app, add the possibility to share my saving circle in a frame.
- good solid clean design.
- works well.
- no bugs.
- Real and useful use case.
- I think this idea is super useful, but the 5% fee  in very transaction is a bit high, would people be willing to pay that?
- A GTM with a human journey/funnel acquisition could help understand these points as well.

---


## AfriCycle

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/africycle)

**General Feedback:**
- Graphics in the deck are AI generated and the text is not real text.
- would not rely on carbon credit market.
- has a lot of issues.
- you did not update the deck.
- still AI created with wrong information on the tech stack.
- It should be a mobile app, so show it in mobile.
- Website works, but should have proper location selection field.
- use a library for that.
- how does the verification between collector and recycler work?
- also, are you using AI to analyze the picture or how do you create a proof?
- Interesting model, few doubts about integrity of proofs and quality of waste recycling submissions.
- There's a strong user case and business model there.
- What is the strategy for onboarding users on all levels?
- I see this only working with a solid gtm.

---


## EventChain

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/eventchain)

**General Feedback:**
- Still no staking for tickets, make it more user friendly with social logins.
- Love that you added the Age verification.
- Makes a lot of sense! User experience is getting so much better!
- would like to see addition of Self added to the deck.
- this makes it actually useful.
- video platform does not really work.
- the video takes forever to load.
- would suggest switching.
-  please add social login as well.
- signing up only with your wallet address is not user friendly.
- you can use thirdweb or portal etc.

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/learna)

**General Feedback:**
- please always have a live deployment for us to test.
- like the community and learning approach a lot.
- Please use AI.
- before you can charge communities, you need to get users and offer this for free. Show what value you bring. 
- now with AI, the cost is not to create the material but to offer the users.
- maybe it would be interesting to have some sor tof game strategy here to incentivize people to participate - rewards, leadership, etc.

---


## Cookie Jar

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/cookie-jar)

**General Feedback:**
- not celo specific.
- good focus on infra and allowlists.
- very web3 specific.

- Demo should show how it works on Celo but on OP.
- Emergency withdrawel does not work.
- notifications would improve the user experience.
- Interesting concept.
- I can see the usage of this for web3 industry.

  - What fees are you taking?

---


## stable-sl

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/stable-sl)

**General Feedback:**
- Update the UI to match OKX wallet or take OneRamp as example for clean design
- I thought in your demo all of it was your app.
- and that you build a wallet around the infra.
- But realizing now, that there has not been an update and the user experience and the UI is still super clunky and does not look trustworthy.
- use a starterkit or components and definitely something to help you design.
- start the FE from scratch maybe?
- Use Bold or windsurf.
- Remove the image in the top and as favicon and create a proper logo.

---

- Share it on Farcaster etc.
- Remove outdated campaigns, that are expried.
- should not be shown.
- Make sure there are incentives for users to take part to attract users to your dapp.
- Status for my campaign does not make sense.
- It shows publicly that it's expired, but in the company view I can see that its stuck and I could expire and delete it.
- Product look solid, but presentation is a bit hard to understand with the pitch deck that was presented.

## Canvassing

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/canvassing)

**General Feedback:**
- like the new design.
- would it be possible to use decentralized form platform instead of Tally?
- congrats of launching in the app store.
- sybil attacks could be an issue.
- are you using good dollar to confirm?
- do you analyze the replies using AI?
- e.g. if someone would just write Test or none, they should not be rewarded.
- How are you doing the payout to minipay?
- how is it connected?
- I think that's super useful, I just can't see how we would make sure theres not people answering many times the same survey.
- A connection to Self would be grand here - just email and phone number is too easy to go around.

- Also improve the UI.
- Bright green on white does not work well.
- Next step would be to think about UX, right now you show transactions hash and wallet addresses.
- Not really web2 friendly.
- consider using account abstraction.
- Please also update your user profiles in Karma, so ecosystem partners are able to reach out.
- app should not be to download, have a live deployment
  - don't trust that.

- Also, you should add your contract, but not the cUSD contract. please remove that. 
  - If you want to make sure to track your transactions, make sure that you are signed up to proof of impact.
